<p>Camp Giraffy is a camp where campers have fun. The campers ride bicycles to camp, paint the Camp Giraffy flag, paint T shirts, paint hats, paint drawings, climb the tree house, play on a water slide, play with water balloons, bake cinnamon bread, play gym, create a talent show, create a circus show, and demonstrate their achievement to grownups. Two of the Camp Giraffy counselors are the famous sister giraffes - Rainbow and Spot. All of the campers love Rainbow and Spot because they are kind, humble, and funny. They treat all of the campers as if they are the most important. One thing Rainbow and Spot emphasize is great teeth brushing. They tell all of the campers, "Do as our Jama told us, 'Brush the teeth you want to keep'". Since the campers want to keep all of their teeth, the faithfully brush all of their teeth. As a result of their wonderful oral hygiene, Rainbow and Spot have the sweetest smelling breath on earth.

<p>One day at Camp Giraffy, Rainbow and Spot were relaxing between Camp Giraffy activities when they overheard a camper, named Evan, talking about Nahfalafagusty, a place that had a purple sun. Evan was a younger dinosaur camper that did not have many friends. He was mostly talking to himself when Rainbow and Spot overheard him. 
<p>Rainbow asked Evan, "Where is Nahfalafagusty?"
<p>Evan answered in a soft voice, "Nahfalafagusty is a planet, similar to earth. You will need a spaceship to travel to Nahfalafagusty."
<p>What Even did not know was the Rainbow and Spot were Super Giraffes, who could fly like a spaceship. After Evan gave Rainbow and Spot the intergalactic coordinates of Nahfalafagusty, Rainbow and Spot decided they had enough time between activities to visit Nahfalafagusty. They immediately started flying to Nahfalafagusty at warp speed.
<p>While Rainbow and Spot were flying to Nahfalafagusty, Pickle and Picklepink, two citizens of Nahfalafagusty, had just settled in for a wonderful picnic under the warm purple sun. Their checkered blanket was perfectly spread, and their picnic basket contained their favorite food - warm cornbread, maple syrup, cantaloupe, peanut butter, and peach ice cream for dessert. Off on a distant mountain, Dirp, another Nahfalafagusty citizen, was also having a picnic.

<p>Just as Pickle and Picklepink were about to open their picnic basket, Burp, who was hiding close by in a tree, descended and launched a stinky burp right in the faces of Pickle and Picklepink. Burp had the stinkiest breath in all of Nahfalafagusty and also all of earth. Pickle and Picklepink felt nauseous. They could not eat. Their picnic was ruined. 
<p>Meanwhile, Dirp, off on a distant mountain was about to begin his picnic. His picnic basket was full of raisins, tomatoes, toasted cinnamon bread, 30 hamburgers, and a hard boiled chicken-rat egg. Evan, the Camp Giraffy camper who told Rainbow and Spot about Nahfalafagusty, had become homesick and decided to return to Nahfalafagusty. Evan had a secret teleport power. He used his power to teleport himself at 5 times the speed of light from Camp Giraffy to a cave close to Dirp's picnic spot. Evan arrived on planet Nahfalafagusty before Rainbow and Spot. Evan was hungry from his teleporting. He strolled to Dirk's picnic, hoping to eat nine of those 30 hamburgers, but Dirk was so hungry that he had already eaten 26 hamburgers. Dirk and Evan decided they would split the remaining four hamburgers. Without warning Burp bounded between the trees and arrived at Dirk and Evan's picnic. Once again, Burp launched a stinky burp right in the faces of Dirp and Evan. Dirp and Evan felt nauseous. They could not eat the remaining hamburgers. Their picnic was ruined. Burp smiled. He had ruined two picnics.

<p>What could save the two ruined picnics? All of a sudden, Rainbow and Spot arrived on the planet Nahfalafagusty. When they arrived the purple sun turned yellow, just like earth's sun. With their sweet smelling breath, the breathed on Pickle, Picklepink, Dirp, and Evan. Their breath was so sweet that it washed the stinky burp away. Pickle, Picklepink, Dirp, and Evan were so happy they laughed loud and long. Their picnics had been saved by the Camp Giraffy Super Giraffes. They were eternally grateful to Rainbow and Spot. They pledged to attend Camp Giraffy each year. Eventually, Pickle, Picklepink, Dirp, and Evan hoped to become Camp Giraffy counselors just like Rainbow and Spot.
