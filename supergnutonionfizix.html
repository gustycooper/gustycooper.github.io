									<h2>Gnute and Knewt</h2>
<p>
Gnute and Knewt are two of the most unlikely best friends you will ever meet.
Gnute is a coypu with beautiful orange teeth.
Knewt is a newt that is exactly the same tinge of orange as Gnute's teeth.
They are both naturally semiaquatic animals, but they are also surprisingly aerial animals.
Gnute is sometimes called a beaver mouse because he has orange, beaver-like teeth that have amazing powers.
Knewt is sometimes called a water-eft or a land-eft. Her orange skin has that ability to poison adversaries.
Together they travel the world. 
When on land, Knewt rides on the back of Gnute.
When in liquid, they both swim side-by-side.
Knewt can fly be flapping her tail.
Gnute can jump so high and puff his body with air that he floats beside Knewt in the sky.
During their world travels, the find secret entrances to amazing kingdoms.
Inside the kingdoms, they help the local citizens by finding food, building shelters, and battling horrible honchos.
									<h2>Kingdoms and Honchos</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kitchen Kingdom and Big Dog Doug
<li>Warehouse Kingdom and Supply Chain Nana
<li>Bicycle Kingdom and Gusty Dot Bike
<li>Gardening Kingdom and Joyful Jama
</ul>
