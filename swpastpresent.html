									<h2>Computer Science Experiences</h2>
									<div class="row">
											<ul>
												<li>I am a lifelong ball player - basketball, football, soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball, horseshoes, cornhole, high jump, running, bicycling. I mostly ride my bicycles now.</li>
												<li>I wrote my first program on an IBM 1600 using punched cards in January, 1974. I do not remember the  programming language.</li>
												<li>I studied math in college. I enjoyed abstract math, and could have gone to UVA graduate school for math, but I did not have enough confidence in my skills / abilities.</li>
												<li>I took several CS courses in college. One was a computer architecture course where I learned assembly programming. Another was a compiler course, where I do not recall learning much; however, I did write a compiler later.</li>
												<li>I worked 34 years as a civilian software/systems engineer for the U.S. Navy.</li>
												<li>My time working for the U.S. Navy, I was primarily a maintenance software / systems engineer. We had large bodies of legacy systems and software. My job was to enhance the legacy systems / software.</li>
												<li>The maintenance programmer's creed - <b>Read the code, not the comments.</b></li>
												<li>I have developed most every kind of software on many different computers.</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Operating Systems - real time.</li>
													<li>File Systems</li>
													<li>Network Stack</li>
													<li>Compilers</li>
													<li>Assemblers</li>
													<li>Linkers</li>
													<li>Real-time naval weapon control systems</li>
												</ul>
												<li>I have been teaching computer science at the University of Mary Washington since January 2012.</li> 
                        <li>I have been an adjunct, full-time fill-in, adjunct, full-time. Recently, I decided that I did not want to teach full-time and returned to being an adjunct.</li>
												<li>I have taught Introduction to Programming in Python, 2nd Programming Course in Java, Object-oriented Programming in Java, Discrete Math, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems.</li>
													<ul class="actions">
														<li><a href="xv6index.html" class="button">CPSC 405</a></li>
													</ul>
												<li>I have taught several independent studies. One was a fancy Java program that "controlled" radiation of melanoma in eyes. The program did not really control. A student worked as an intern and had several videos of manually controlled radiation. We used his videos to create a prototype system.</li>
												<li>I have taken several UMW courses. I have taken Object-oriented Programming, Application of Data Bases, Data Mining, Computer Security, IT Infrastructure in the Cloud, and Web Development. This creates a fun dynamic. I am teaching some students while at the same time I am in a class with them.</li>
												<li>As part of my teaching Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, I am developing Charm, a system to help teach these subjects.</li>
