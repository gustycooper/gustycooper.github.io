									<h2>Computer Science Experiences</h2>
									<div class="row">
											<ul>
												<li>I am a lifelong ball player - basketball, football, soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball, horseshoes, cornhole, high jump, running, bicycling. I mostly ride my bicycles now.</li>
												<li>I wrote my first program on an IBM 1600 using punched cards in January, 1974. I do not remember the  programming language.</li>
												<li>I studied math in college. I enjoyed abstract math, and could have gone to UVA graduate school for math, but I did not have enough confidence in my skills / abilities.</li>
												<li>I took several CS courses in college. One was a computer architecture course where I learned assembly programming. Another was a compiler course, where I do not recall learning much; however, I did write a compiler later.</li>
												<li>I worked 34 years as a civilian software/systems engineer for the U.S. Navy.</li>
												<li>My time working for the U.S. Navy, I was primarily a maintenance software / systems engineer. We had large bodies of legacy systems and software. My job was to enhance the legacy systems / software.</li>
												<li>The maintenance programmer's creed - <b>Read the code, not the comments.</b></li>
												<li>I have developed most every kind of software on many different computers.</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Operating Systems - real time.</li>
													<li>File Systems</li>
													<li>Network Stack</li>
													<li>Compilers</li>
													<li>Assemblers</li>
													<li>Linkers</li>
													<li>Real-time naval weapon control systems</li>

									<h2>Ongoing Computer Science Projects</h2>
									<div class="row">
											<ul>
												<li>I teach computer science at the University of Mary Washington. I have been teaching for 11 years. I have been an adjunct, full-time fill-in, adjunct, full-time, and currently a full-time lecturer.</li>
												<li>I have taught Introduction to Programming in Python, 2nd Programming Course in Java, Object-oriented Programming in Java, Discrete Math, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems.</li>
												<li>I have taught several independent studies. One was a fancy Java program that "controlled" radiation of melanoma in eyes. The program did not really control. A student worked as an intern and had several videos of manually controlled radiation. We used his videos to create a prototype system.</li>
												<li>When I have extra time in a semester, I take a UWM course. I have taken Object-oriented Programming, Application of Data Bases, Data Mining, Computer Security, IT Infrastructure in the Cloud, and Web Development. This creates a fun dynamic. I am teaching some students while at the same time I am in a class with them.</li>
												<li>As part of my teaching Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, I am developing Charm, a system to help teach these subjects. Charm has several components.</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Charm Instruction Set Architecture - A 32-bit ISA that is a simplified version of the ARM A32.</li>
													<li>Charm Assembly - The definition of an assembly code for the Charm ISA.</li>
													<li>Chasm - An assembler that translates Charm assembly code into "binary".</li>
													<li>Chibicc - A C compiler that that translates C into Charm assembly code. Chibicc is a compiler created by Rui Ueyama. See <a href="https://github.com/rui314/chibicc">Chibicc by Rui Ueyama</a>. I have modified Rui's code generator to generate Charm assembly. The Chibicc code generater is mostly correct; however, it generates code that is a stack machine so the code is not efficient and does not use Charm registers well. I have a goal to improve the code generator.</li>
													<li>Chemu - A Charm emulator that runs Charm binaries. Chemu allows you to load Charm binaries, inspect/change registers, inspect/change memory, step through code, set break points, and run code. Charm supports simple printf/scanf in Chemu. Chemu exists in two forms - ncurses that has "windows" in a Linux termina and terminal - that scrolls as you enter commands.</li>
													<li>ChOS - An operating system that runs in Chemu. At this time ChOS is not much of an OS, but I hope to improve it.</li>
													<li>Chlink - A linker that can combine Charm binaries. I have begun working on Chlink, but it is an infant.</li>
													<li>Cherver - A localhost web-server that can run Chemu. Cherver is an idea at this time.</li>
													<li>Chtml - A web frontend that can connect to Chever. Chtml is an idea at this time. The goal of Cherver and Chtml is to create a fancy browser-based GUI front end to Chemu, which will complement the ncurses and terminal user interfaces.</li>
