<p><a name="grading"></a>
<h2>Class Grading Policy</h2>

<p>Grades in CPSC 405 will be based on:
  <ul>

   <li> <b>Labs: (50%)</b>
<ul>
<li>For the most part, your grade will be what you assign yourself.
<li>I reserve the right to adjust your grade based upon comments/grades in your
teammates submissions, your <tt>make grade</tt>, how well you answered the lab's 
questions in your notebook, and how you perform during Check-off Meetings.
<li>See <a href="labsubmissions.html">Lab Submissions</a> for more information.
<li><b>You must submit all labs in order to pass the class.</b>
</ul>

   <li> <b>Lab Check-off Meetings: (15%)</b>  
<ul>
<li>During the lab check-off meetings I
   will ask you a few questions about your lab solution.  
<li>I plan to hold 3 or 4 lab check-off meetings per team for randomly-selected labs. 
<li> The lab check-off meetings will be conducted during Lab Days.
<li> A successful Check-off meeting will result in the same score your assigned
   yourself on the lab, or we could agree to a better score.
<li> An unsuccessful Check-off Meeting will result in a lower score than your
   lab, and it could result in lowering your lab score.
<li> Missing a Check-off Meeting without a legitimate excuse is considered
   an unsuccessful Check-off Meeting. 
</ul>
   <li> <b>Class notebook: (10%)</b> 
<ul>
<li>Everyone is responsible for maintaining a handwritten class notebook.
<li>Your notebook should be of a form that supports retention of the sheets of paper.
For example, a spiral notebook or a ring binder.
<li>In your notebook, you will take notes, perform inclass exercises, and answer lab questions.
<li>I will examine your class notebook during Lab Check-off Meetings and during inclass exercises.
</ul>
   <li> <b>Class participation: (10%)</b> 
<ul>
<li>Our classes allow you to participate, ask questions,
     and work on labs. 
<li>I expect you to be in class. 
<li>I will take roll.
<li>Homework questions are included in Class Participation
</ul>
   <li><b>Quizzes: (0%)</b>
<ul>
<li>There will be no quizzes.
</ul>
   <li> <b>Final Exam: (15%)</b> 
<ul>
<li> The final exam will be an oral presentation where you and
   your teammates describe what you have learned in CPSC 405. 
<li> I will provide guidance
   to help you prepare your presentation.
</ul>

  </ul>


<p><a name="labsubmission"></a>
<h2>Class Labs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Labs are the most important component of our class.
<li>The labs are a <i><b>learn by doing</b></i> component of our course and involve significant programming.
<li>Labs are designed to improve your computer science skills and knowledge.
<li>We have two types of labs. The majority of our labs are Xv6-based Labs. 
These labs are completed by adding code to Xv6, building, running, and testing
your Xv6 code.
We have a few Linux-based Labs. These labs are completed by creating standalone
C programs that run on Linux.
<li>See <a href="labsubmissions.html">Lab Submissions</a> for the details of submitting labs.
</ul>

<p><a name="lablaterules"></a>
<h2>Labs Submitted Late Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>The submission deadline is 11:59:59pm on the day that the
  lab is due. You can turn in as many times as you like before the
  deadline. 

<li>For Xv6-based labs, your lab score will be a combination of the value computed by <tt>make grade</tt>,
  and how well you answered the lab's questions in your notebook.

<li> You have a total of 48 late hours for the semester. Each hour late in excess
  of 48 hours will penalize your total lab grade by 1&#37;, up to a maximum of
  50%. Suppose your lab average is a 90, and you have 50 late hours. Your lab 
  average is reduced to 88.

<li>Late hours must be used before Thanksgiving.

<li> For predictable situations (athletic events, deadlines in
  other classes, job interviews, etc.), I expect you to manage your time
  so as to finish assignments by the due date; however, you can use your late hours. 
  If you have exhausted your late hours and encounter an emergency that causes
  you to need an extension, please talk with me.
</ul>

<!-- That is, the lab component of the overall grade drops by
       ceil((cumulative late - 72 hours)/1 day)
     letter grades. -->


<p><a name="labteams"></a>
<h2>Class Lab Teams</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will be placed in a Lab Team of 2 or 3 students. 
<ul>
<li>Teams will work together to complete labs. 
<li>Teams will divvy the work among teammates as they see fit; however,
the division must be equal.
<li>Each team member must submit labs on Canvas.
</ul>
</ul>

<p><a name="labdays"></a>
<h2>Class Lab Days</h2>
<ul>
<li>Labs are due at midnight on a Friday. 
<li>The Tuesdays before labs are due are Class Lab Days.
<li>I will be available to help you with labs.
<li>You are expected to be in class on Class Lab Days.
<li>Missing a Class Lab Day results in a deduction from your class participation, which is 10% of your grade.
Examples of missing Class Lab Days.
<ul>
<li>The first missed Class Lab Day means the max you can earn is an 80 on class participation.
<li>The second missed Class Lab Day means the max you can earn is a 60 on class participation.
<li>The third missed Class Lab Day means the max you can earn is a 40 on class participation.
<li>The fourth missed Class Lab Day means the max you can earn is a 20 on class participation.
<li>The fifth missed Class Lab Day means the max you can earn is a 0 on class participation.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="homework">Class Lecture Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of lecture questions is to make you study and think
about the lecture topic prior to the lecture. 
<li>For each lecture class, you must read the material and submit a quesiton on Canvas.
<li>Submit your lecture questions on Canvas by midnight
on the day before the lecture
on the specified due dates.
<li>We can address questions during the lecture.
<li>You can miss a few lecture questions over the semester
without any penalty.
<li>The lecture questions are part of your class participation grade.
</ul>

<h2 id="textbook">Class Textbooks</h2>

<p>CPSC 405 relies on the following books:
<ul>

  <li><a href="xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6: A simple, Unix-like teaching operating
      system</a> by R. Cox, F. Kaashoek, and R. Morris.
  <li> <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OS Three Easy Pieces</a>
       by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau.

  <li><a href=https://ia903407.us.archive.org/35/items/the-ansi-c-programming-language-by-brian-w.-kernighan-dennis-m.-ritchie.org/The%20ANSI%20C%20Programming%20Language%20by%20Brian%20W.%20Kernighan%2C%20Dennis%20M.%20Ritchie.pdf>The C Programming Language (second edition)</a> Brian W. Kernighan
and Dennis M. Ritchie. Prentice Hall, Inc., 1988. ISBN 0-13-110362-8, 1998.

</ul>

<p><a name="collaboration"></a>
<h2>Class Collaboration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Teammates work together on labs and thus may help each other however they desire.
<li>You are welcome to discuss the labs (and homeworks) with other
teams/students, but the discussion must focus on understanding the lab.
<li>Any discussions with people not on your team must <b>not</b> involve the following:
<ul>
<li>Detailed design.
<li>How to create code.
<li>Copying code.
<li>How to create test cases.
<li>Copying test cases.
</ul>
<li>All of your team's written work and code must be your own team's work and
must carefully acknowledge all contributions of ideas by others,
whether from classmates or from sources you have read. 
<li>Please don't look at any other team's code. This is not allowed. 
<li>Please feel free to ask and answer questions on Discord, about labs (for understanding), homework, readings,
and lectures.
<li> <b>Do not post your lab or homework solutions on publicly accessible web
sites (such as GitHub) or file spaces.</b> This rule applies after you have completed
the class so future students are not tempted to copy solutions.
</ul>
