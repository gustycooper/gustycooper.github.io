<TITLE>Debugging with GDB - Examining Source Files</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="gdb_8.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="gdb_10.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="gdb_toc.html#SEC48">Examining Source Files</A></H1>
<P>
GDB can print parts of your program's source, since the debugging
information recorded in the program tells GDB what source files were
used to build it.  When your program stops, GDB spontaneously prints
the line where it stopped.  Likewise, when you select a stack frame
(see section <A HREF="gdb_8.html#SEC45">Selecting a frame</A>), GDB prints the line where
execution in that frame has stopped.  You can print other portions of
source files by explicit command.
<P>
If you use GDB through its GNU Emacs interface, you may prefer to use
Emacs facilities to view source; see section <A HREF="gdb_18.html#SEC144">Using GDB under GNU Emacs</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="gdb_toc.html#SEC49">Printing source lines</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<P>
To print lines from a source file, use the <CODE>list</CODE> command
(abbreviated <CODE>l</CODE>).  There are several ways to specify what part
of the file you want to print.
<P>
Here are the forms of the <CODE>list</CODE> command most commonly used:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>list <VAR>linenum</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print lines centered around line number <VAR>linenum</VAR> in the
current source file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list <VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print lines centered around the beginning of function
<VAR>function</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list</CODE>
<DD>Print more lines.  If the last lines printed were printed with a
<CODE>list</CODE> command, this prints lines following the last lines
printed; however, if the last line printed was a solitary line printed
as part of displaying a stack frame (see section <A HREF="gdb_8.html#SEC42">Examining the Stack</A>), this prints lines centered around that line.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list -</CODE>
<DD>Print lines just before the lines last printed.
</DL>
<P>
By default, GDB prints ten source lines with any of these forms of
the <CODE>list</CODE> command.  You can change this using <CODE>set listsize</CODE>:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<DT><CODE>set listsize <VAR>count</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Make the <CODE>list</CODE> command display <VAR>count</VAR> source lines (unless
the <CODE>list</CODE> argument explicitly specifies some other number).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<DT><CODE>show listsize</CODE>
<DD>Display the number of lines that <CODE>list</CODE> prints.
</DL>
<P>
Repeating a <CODE>list</CODE> command with <KBD>RET</KBD> discards the argument,
so it is equivalent to typing just <CODE>list</CODE>.  This is more useful
than listing the same lines again.  An exception is made for an
argument of <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>; that argument is preserved in repetition so that
each repetition moves up in the source file.
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<P>
In general, the <CODE>list</CODE> command expects you to supply zero, one or two
<DFN>linespecs</DFN>.  Linespecs specify source lines; there are several ways
of writing them but the effect is always to specify some source line.
Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for <CODE>list</CODE>:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>list <VAR>linespec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print lines centered around the line specified by <VAR>linespec</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list <VAR>first</VAR>,<VAR>last</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print lines from <VAR>first</VAR> to <VAR>last</VAR>.  Both arguments are
linespecs.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list ,<VAR>last</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print lines ending with <VAR>last</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list <VAR>first</VAR>,</CODE>
<DD>Print lines starting with <VAR>first</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list +</CODE>
<DD>Print lines just after the lines last printed.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list -</CODE>
<DD>Print lines just before the lines last printed.
<P>
<DT><CODE>list</CODE>
<DD>As described in the preceding table.
</DL>
<P>
Here are the ways of specifying a single source line--all the
kinds of linespec.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE><VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies line <VAR>number</VAR> of the current source file.
When a <CODE>list</CODE> command has two linespecs, this refers to
the same source file as the first linespec.
<P>
<DT><CODE>+<VAR>offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies the line <VAR>offset</VAR> lines after the last line printed.
When used as the second linespec in a <CODE>list</CODE> command that has
two, this specifies the line <VAR>offset</VAR> lines down from the
first linespec.
<P>
<DT><CODE>-<VAR>offset</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies the line <VAR>offset</VAR> lines before the last line printed.
<P>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies line <VAR>number</VAR> in the source file <VAR>filename</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><CODE><VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies the line of the open-brace that begins the body of the
function <VAR>function</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><CODE><VAR>filename</VAR>:<VAR>function</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies the line of the open-brace that begins the body of the
function <VAR>function</VAR> in the file <VAR>filename</VAR>.  You only need the
file name with a function name to avoid ambiguity when there are
identically named functions in different source files.
<P>
<DT><CODE>*<VAR>address</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specifies the line containing the program address <VAR>address</VAR>.
<VAR>address</VAR> may be any expression.
</DL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="gdb_toc.html#SEC50">Searching source files</A></H2>
<P>
There are two commands for searching through the current source file for a
regular expression.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>forward-search <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
<DT><CODE>search <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>The command <SAMP>`forward-search <VAR>regexp</VAR>'</SAMP> checks each line,
starting with the one following the last line listed, for a match for
<VAR>regexp</VAR>.  It lists the line that is found.  You can use
synonym <SAMP>`search <VAR>regexp</VAR>'</SAMP> or abbreviate the command name as
<CODE>fo</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>reverse-search <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>The command <SAMP>`reverse-search <VAR>regexp</VAR>'</SAMP> checks each line, starting
with the one before the last line listed and going backward, for a match
for <VAR>regexp</VAR>.  It lists the line that is found.  You can abbreviate
this command as <CODE>rev</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="gdb_toc.html#SEC51">Specifying source directories</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<P>
Executable programs sometimes do not record the directories of the source
files from which they were compiled, just the names.  Even when they do,
the directories could be moved between the compilation and your debugging
session.  GDB has a list of directories to search for source files;
this is called the <DFN>source path</DFN>.  Each time GDB wants a source file,
it tries all the directories in the list, in the order they are present
in the list, until it finds a file with the desired name.  Note that
the executable search path is <EM>not</EM> used for this purpose.  Neither is
the current working directory, unless it happens to be in the source
path.
<P>
If GDB cannot find a source file in the source path, and the
object program records a directory, GDB tries that directory
too.  If the source path is empty, and there is no record of the
compilation directory, GDB looks in the current directory as a
last resort.
<P>
Whenever you reset or rearrange the source path, GDB clears out
any information it has cached about where source files are found and where
each line is in the file.
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<P>
When you start GDB, its source path is empty.
To add other directories, use the <CODE>directory</CODE> command.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>directory <VAR>dirname</VAR> ...</CODE>
<DD>Add directory <VAR>dirname</VAR> to the front of the source path.  Several
directory names may be given to this command, separated by <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> or
whitespace.  You may specify a directory that is already in the source
path; this moves it forward, so GDB searches it sooner.
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<P>
You can use the string <SAMP>`$cdir'</SAMP> to refer to the compilation
directory (if one is recorded), and <SAMP>`$cwd'</SAMP> to refer to the current
working directory.  <SAMP>`$cwd'</SAMP> is not the same as <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>---the former
tracks the current working directory as it changes during your GDB
session, while the latter is immediately expanded to the current
directory at the time you add an entry to the source path.
<P>
<DT><CODE>directory</CODE>
<DD>Reset the source path to empty again.  This requires confirmation.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<DT><CODE>show directories</CODE>
<DD>Print the source path: show which directories it contains.
</DL>
<P>
If your source path is cluttered with directories that are no longer of
interest, GDB may sometimes cause confusion by finding the wrong
versions of source.  You can correct the situation as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Use <CODE>directory</CODE> with no argument to reset the source path to empty.
<P>
<LI>
Use <CODE>directory</CODE> with suitable arguments to reinstall the
directories you want in the source path.  You can add all the
directories in one command.
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="gdb_toc.html#SEC52">Source and machine code</A></H2>
<P>
You can use the command <CODE>info line</CODE> to map source lines to program
addresses (and vice versa), and the command <CODE>disassemble</CODE> to display
a range of addresses as machine instructions.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<DT><CODE>info line <VAR>linespec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Print the starting and ending addresses of the compiled code for
source line <VAR>linespec</VAR>.  You can specify source lines in any of
the ways understood by the <CODE>list</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC49">Printing source lines</A>).
</DL>
<P>
For example, we can use <CODE>info line</CODE> to discover the location of
the object code for the first line of function
<CODE>m4_changequote</CODE>:
<P>
<PRE>
(gdb) info line m4_changecom
Line 895 of "builtin.c" starts at pc 0x634c and ends at 0x6350.
</PRE>
<P>
We can also inquire (using <CODE>*<VAR>addr</VAR></CODE> as the form for
<VAR>linespec</VAR>) what source line covers a particular address:
<PRE>
(gdb) info line *0x63ff
Line 926 of "builtin.c" starts at pc 0x63e4 and ends at 0x6404.
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<P>
After <CODE>info line</CODE>, the default address for the <CODE>x</CODE> command
is changed to the starting address of the line, so that <SAMP>`x/i'</SAMP> is
sufficient to begin examining the machine code (see section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC58">Examining memory</A>).  Also, this address is saved as the value of the
convenience variable <CODE>$_</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC62">Convenience variables</A>).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
<DT><CODE>disassemble</CODE>
<DD>This specialized command dumps a range of memory as machine
instructions.  The default memory range is the function surrounding the
program counter of the selected frame.  A single argument to this
command is a program counter value; GDB dumps the function
surrounding this value.  Two arguments specify a range of addresses
(first inclusive, second exclusive) to dump.
</DL>
<P>
We can use <CODE>disassemble</CODE> to inspect the object code
range shown in the last <CODE>info line</CODE> example (the example
shows SPARC machine instructions):
<P>
<PRE>
(gdb) disas 0x63e4 0x6404
Dump of assembler code from 0x63e4 to 0x6404:
