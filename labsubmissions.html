CPSC 405 Lab Submissions
</H1>
<p>
<b><a href="#submittinglabs">Submitting Labs</a></b>, 
<b><a href="#textfile">Text File Submission</a></b>,
<b><a href="#zipfile">Zip File Submission</a></b>

<p>Labs are designed to improve your computer science skills and knowledge. The labs are a learn by doing component of our course and involve significant programming.

<p>We have two types of labs. The majority of our labs are Xv6-based Labs. 
These labs are completed by adding code to Xv6, building, running, and testing
your Xv6 code.
We have a few Linux-based Labs. These labs are completed by creating standalone
C programs that run on Linux.

<div class="question">
<p><b>Lab Questions - 25 points</b>
<p>Our labs have questions that you must answer. Questions are in boxes (like this) with a light orange background. 
<ul>
<li>Questions are worth 25 points on the lab. 
<li>You must handwrite the answers to questions in a notebook or tablet.
<li>Your notebook must include both the questions and your answers to get full credit. You can abbreviate some of the question, but you must write enough so that the question is understandable.
<li>If you choose to just write the answers without the questions, you can earn up to 15 points.
<li>I will not read and correct your answers to the questions. The answers are in our class material. You can consult with anyone and AI when answering questions. If you cannot find the answer, you must ask me or another student.
<li>As described in <b><a href="#textfile">Text File Submission</a></b>, you will state the percentage of lab questions completed. For the most part, whatever you state is the grade you will receive. For example, if on your submission you state, 
<i>"I have handwritten 85% of the questions and answers in my notebook."</i>; you will earn 21.25 points.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="required">
<p><b>Lab Programming Problems - 75 points</b>
<p>Our labs have programming problems that you must create design, implement code, create test cases, and test you implementation to demonstrate it works.
<ul>
<li>Programming problems are worth 75 points.
<li>The 75 points for programming problems are for design, implementation, test case creation, and testing.
<li>I provide many test cases that you use. For my provided test cases, you use them and I will see you execute them in your .txt file lab submission on Canvas.
<li>For some problems, I ask you to design, create, and execute test cases. For test cases that you must create, I will see you execute them in your .txt file lab submssion on Canvas, but you must also describe them in your .txt file.
<li>As described in <b><a href="#textfile">Text File Submission</a></b>, you will state the percentage of programming problems completed. For the most part, whatever you state is the grade you will receive. For example, if on your submission you state,
<i>"I have successfully designed, implemented, and tested 100% of the problems."</i>; you will earn 75 points. The following are examples of submissions that do not earn the amount of points claimed.
<ul>
<li>Failure to include at least five things you learned on the lab.
<li>Failure to include a copy/paste of you running the programs and test cases.
<li>Failure to describe the test cases that you must complete.
</ul>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="warning">
<p><b>Lab Nuances</b>
<p>Additionally, in the directory of your xv6-labs, create two files: <b>answers-LAB.txt</b> and <b>time.txt</b>. For the <b>answers-LAB.txt</b> file, the string <b>LAB</b> 
corresponds to the lab you are submitting, and  For example, <b>answer-util.txt</b> is the file for the util lab. I may use these files 
if I run your code using your zip file submission. The answers-firstlab.txt is a blank file. The time.txt file contains
the number of hours you spent on the lab. Create the files by the following.
<pre>
$ echo > answers-util.txt
$ echo 8 > time.txt
</pre>
</ul>
</div>

<p><a name="submittinglabs"></a>
<h2>Submitting Labs</h2>
<h3><b>Each student must submit their lab material on Canvas.</b></h3>
<p>Each lab has two Canvas assignments in which you submit your lab material. 
<ul>
<li><b>Text File Assignment</b> - you submit your (for example) <tt>lab-util-handin.txt</tt> file, which is described below.
The Text File submission must show that the code is run on each individual's computer system.
<li><b>Zip File Assignment</b> - you submit your (for example) <tt>lab-util-handin.tar.gz</tt> file, which is described below.
</ul>
I will primarily use the Text File submission to grade your lab. If necessary, I will run your code using the Zip File submission.
<p><a name="zipfile"></a>
<h3><b>Zip File</b></h3>
<p>The Zip file contains the source code, Makefile, etc., of your lab. The Zip file is submitted in the lab's Zip File Assignment on Canvas.
<ul>
<li><b>Xv6:</b> A zipped tar file of you lab code. The name <b>tar</b> is short for <b>T</b>ape <b>AR</b>chive, and in the
past magnetic tapes were used to archive files for safe keeping. The Linux utility <tt>tar</tt>
creates tar files.
<ul>
<li>To create the zipped tar file, run <tt>make tarball</tt> in your lab
  directory, which creates (for example) the file <tt>lab-<b>util</b>-handin.tar.gz</tt>,
where <b>util</b> is the name of the lab.
  The name of the <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file depends upon the lab. 
  Submit this file on Canvas.
</ul>
<li><b>Linux</b> A Zip file of your directory.
  Submit the resulting <tt>.zip</tt> file to Canvas.
</ul>
<p>The following image shows Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie using a PDP-11 computer.
They began Unix development on a PDP-7, which had 8K, 18-bit words of memory. After a few years, they continued development of Unix on a PDP-11.
The orange lines encircle tapes that would have been used to backup code in an archive.

<p><a name="textfile"></a>
<h3><b>Text File</b></h3>
<p>The text file contains your reflections and a copy/paste of you building, running, and testing the programming problems associated with the lab. The text file name shall be for example, <tt>lab-<b>util</b>-handin.txt</tt>,
where <b>util</b> is the name of the lab. The text file is the same for both Xv6 and Linux labs. The text file is submitted in the lab's Text File Assignment on Canvas.
The text file shall be neatly organized items in the following order.
<ul>
<li><i>Name</i>: Your name.
<li><i>Hours Spent</i>: The number of hours you spent on the lab.
<li><i>Overall Assessment</i>: A high-level descriptive honor declaration of how much of the entire lab you have successfully completed.
<br>NOTE: This does not have to be the UMW honor pledge, but it is equivalent to a UMW honor pledge.
Here are a couple of sample honor declarations.
<ul>
<li><i>I have successfully completed 100% of the lab.</i> - this earns a 100 on the lab.
<li><i>I have successfully completed 85% of the lab.</i> - this earns an 85 on the lab.
</ul>
<li><i>Questions</i>: An honor declaration that you have completed the questions in your handwritten notebook.
Here are a couple of sample honor declarations.
<ul>
<li><i>I have handwritten 100% of the questions and answers in my notebook.</i> - this earns 25 points.
<li><i>I have handwritten 85% of the questions and answers in my notebook.</i> - this earns 21.25 points.
</ul>
<li><i>Programming Problems</i>: An honor declaration that you have completed the programming problems.
Here are a couple of sample honor declarations.
<ul>
<li><i>I have successfully designed, implemented, and tested 100% of the programming problems.</i> - this earns 75 points.
<li><i>I have successfully designed, implemented, and tested 85% of the programming problems.</i> - this earns 63.75 points.
</ul>
<li><i>Learning</i>: A list of at least five things you learned on this lab and the lecture material related to this lab The following shows a sample.
<p><p><i>I have learned the following.</i>
<ol>
<li><i>I learned ... state something you have learned</i>.
<li><i>I learned ... state something you have learned</i>.
<li><i>I learned ... state something you have learned</i>.
<li><i>I learned ... state something you have learned</i>.
<li><i>I learned ... state something you have learned</i>.
</ol>
<li><i>Collaboration - Including the use of AI</i>: If you helped someone or someone helped you or your used AI on the lab, you describe the help here. Collaboration and AI can be used freely on the questions. For programming problems, you must first attempt to solve the problem using your brain. Collaboration and AI are to be used only when you get stuck on solving a problem.
<li><i>Test Cases</i>: A descriptive list of the test cases you created for specific problem solutions. I provide many test cases. You do not have to describe the test cases that I provide. On some programming problems, I ask you to create some test cases. You must describe your test cases here.
<p><p><i>I have successfully created 100% of the required test cases.</i>
<ol>
<li><i>Programming Problem XXX</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Test Case 1</i> - describe the test case.
<li><i>... other test cases as needed</i>
</ul>
<li><i>Programming Problem XXX</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Test Case 2</i> - describe the test case.
<li><i>... other test cases as needed</i>
</ul>
</ol>
<li><i>Build, Run, and Test</i>: A copy/paste of you building, running, and testing your lab problem program solutions. This should show that you are using your account. It should show you running and testing all of the lab problems - even those problems where I have provided the solution code.
</ul>

<h4>Text File Sample</h4>
<pre>
Name: Gusty Cooper

Hours Spent: 7

Overall Assessment: I have successfully completed 100% of the lab.

Questions: I have handwritten 100% of the questions and answers in my notebook.

Overall Assessment: I have successfully designed, implemented, and tested 100% of the problems.

Learning:
1. I understand the Xv6 API.
2. I learned that fork() creates child process that is an identical copy of the parent.
3. I learned that exec() runs a program located on the disk.
4. I learned that exec() overwrites the calling process with the program that is executed.
5. I learned that pipe() returns two file descriptors. 
6. I learned that a file descriptor is a small integer that can be used with read() and write().
7. ... more if you learned more ...

Collaboration:
I worked with Susan and Bobby to answer the questions. Susan was especially helpful.
I got stuck on programming problem number 4 - forkexec. I consulted with Gusty, who explained the concepts and I now understand it.
I helped Matilda with her programming problems.
