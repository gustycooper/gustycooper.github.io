<h1>Lab: page tables</h1>

<p> In this lab you will explore page tables and modify them to
  speed up certain system calls and to detect which pages have been accessed.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 3 of
  the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and related files:

  <ul>
   <li> <tt>kernel/memlayout.h</tt>, which captures the layout of memory.
	  
    <li> <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>, which contains most virtual memory (VM) code.

    <li> <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>, which contains code for allocating and
    freeing physical memory.
  
  </ul>

It may also help to consult the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMFDQC-and-Priv-v1.11/riscv-privileged-20190608.pdf">RISC-V privileged architecture manual</a>.

</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. You will state the percentage of questions answered on your lab submission.
<p>The Linux <tt>grep</tt> command can be helpful on some questions. For example, suppose a question asks you about the macro <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt>. You can discover the definition and uses of the macro <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> by issuing the following Linux <tt>grep</tt> command in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
<pre>
$ <kbd>grep TRAPFRAME *.h</kbd>
memlayout.h://   TRAPFRAME (p->trapframe, used by the trampoline)
memlayout.h:#define TRAPFRAME (TRAMPOLINE - PGSIZE)
memlayout.h:#define USYSCALL (TRAPFRAME - PGSIZE)
% <kbd>grep TRAPFRAME *.c</kbd>
proc.c:  if(mappages(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, PGSIZE,
proc.c:     uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
proc.c:  uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
</pre>

<h2>Problem 1: Mapping USYSCALL page <script>g("easy - partial solution code provided")</script></h2>
<p>The first six questions are warmup. Refer to Figure 3-2 of our <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook</a>.

<div class="question">
<p><b>1.</b> Draw a diagram of a RISC-V virtual address (VA).
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>2.</b> Draw a diagram of a RISC-V physical address (PA).
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>3.</b> Draw a diagram of a RISC-V page table entry? Underneath of your diagram, write the meanings of the PTE fields/bits? For example, the V bit means this PTE refers to a valid page that is part of the proc's address page. Another way to say this is the VA is mapped to a PA.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>4.</b> How many bits is a physical address (PA)?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>5.</b> How many bits is a virtual address (VA)?

<div class="question">
<p><b>6.</b> How many bits is a physical page number?
</div>

<p>
Some operating systems (e.g., Linux) speed up certain system calls by sharing
data in a read-only region between userspace and the kernel. This eliminates the
need for kernel crossings when performing these system calls.  To help you learn
how to insert mappings into a page table, your first task is to implement this
optimization for the <tt>getpid()</tt> system call in xv6.

<div class="required">
<p>When each process is created, map one read-only page at USYSCALL (a
virtual address defined
in <tt>memlayout.h</tt>). At the start of this page, store a <tt>struct
usyscall</tt> (also defined in <tt>memlayout.h</tt>), and initialize it to store
the PID of the current process. 
This initial mapping is done in the kernel, which creates processes.
You must also map this page in the proc's pagetable.
For this lab, <tt>ugetpid()</tt> has been
provided on the userspace side and will automatically use the USYSCALL mapping.
You will receive full credit for this part of the lab if the <tt>ugetpid</tt> test
case passes when running <tt>pgtbltest</tt>.
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The file <tt>proc.c</tt> contains functions that manipulate processes - 
      fork or create procs, allocate the procs' pagetables, exit procs,
      schedule procs, wait for a child, sleep, wakeup, etc.
      The system call <tt>fork</tt> calls the <tt>fork()</tt> function in <tt>proc.c</tt>.
      The function <tt>fork()</tt> calls the function <tt>allocproc()</tt> to allocate a process.
      When Xv6 boots, the <tt>init</tt> process is allocated. The <tt>init</tt> 
The <tt>init</tt> process has PID 1. When the system is bootstrapping, 
<tt>kernel/main.c</tt> calls <tt>userinit()</tt>, which is located in <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.
<tt>userinit()</tt> creates the first user process, which is assembly code located 
in <tt>user/initcode.S</tt>. This initial process calls <tt>exec()</tt> to execute the program
<tt>user/init.c</tt>, which is the <tt>init</tt> process that has PID 1. 
      The init process <tt>fork</tt>s itself and <tt>exec</tt>s the <tt>sh</tt> program,
      which is the Xv6 shell you use in your terminal. 
      Whenever <tt>fork()</tt> is called, it allocates a process, which must do such 
      things as allocate a trapframe page and establish the process's pagetable. For 
      this problem you must update <tt>allocproc()</tt> to allocate a page for the 
      process at virtual address <tt>USYSCALL</tt>, place a <tt>struct usyscall</tt> in the
      page, and assign the <tt>pid</tt> to the <tt>usyscall</tt> member <tt>int pid</tt>.
      You must also update <tt>proc_pagetable()</tt> to properly map the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> address
      to the process's page table.
    <p>You should study how <tt>allocproc()</tt> allocates the <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> page to get
      ideas for how to allocate the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> page.

      The <tt>TRAMPOLINE</tt> page is mapped to the top of the virtual address space,
      and <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> is the page immediately below <tt>TRAMPOLINE</tt>.
      You can study <tt>memlayout.h</tt> as you examine Figure 3.3 of

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>We provide the user program <tt>pgtbltest.c</tt>. It tests the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> page with the <tt>pid</tt> defined in the problem and the <tt>pgaccess()</tt> system call defined in the third problem of this lab. <tt>pgtbltest</tt> has two testing functions.
<ul>
<li><tt>ugetpid_test()</tt> - This calls <tt>ugetpid()</tt> to retrieve the <tt>pid</tt> from the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> and compares it to the <tt>pid</tt> returned from the system call <tt>getpid()</tt>. The user function <tt>ugetpid()</tt> has been added to <tt>ulib.c</tt>. The code for <tt>ugetpid</tt> is the following.
<pre>
int
ugetpid(void)
{
  struct usyscall *u = (struct usyscall *)USYSCALL;
  return u->pid;
}
</pre>
<li><tt>pgaccess_test()</tt> - This uses <tt>malloc()</tt> to allocate 32 pages, and it modifies (or accesses) pages 1, 2, and 30.
The returned bits from <tt>pgaccess(buf, 32 &abits)</tt> should have bits 1, 2, and 30 set.
</ul>
<h2>Problem 2: Print a page table <script>g("easy - solution code provided")</script></h2>

<p>
To help you visualize RISC-V page tables, and perhaps
to aid future debugging, your second task is to write a function
that prints the contents of a page table.

<div class="required">
<p>Define a function called <tt>vmprint()</tt>.
It should take
a <tt>pagetable_t</tt> argument, and print that pagetable
in the format described below.
Insert 
<p>
<tt>if(p->pid==1) vmprint(p->pagetable)</tt>
<p> in
  <tt>exec.c</tt> just before the <tt>return argc</tt>,
to print the first process's page table.
  
</div>


<p>
Now when you start xv6 it should print output like this, describing
the page table of the first process at the point when it has just
finished <tt>exec()</tt>ing <tt>init</tt>:

<pre>
page table 0x0000000087f6b000
 ..0: pte 0x0000000021fd9c01 pa 0x0000000087f67000

init: starting sh
</pre>

<div class="question">
<p><b>13.</b> Why do all of the physical addresses end with three hexadecimal zeros?
</div>

The first line displays the argument to <tt>vmprint</tt>.
After that there is a line for each PTE, including PTEs that
refer to page-table pages deeper in the tree.
Each PTE line is indented by a number of <tt>" .."</tt> that indicates its
depth in the tree.
Each PTE line shows the PTE index in its page-table page, the pte bits, and the
physical address extracted from the PTE.
Don't print PTEs that are not valid.  In the above example, the
top-level page-table page (L2 in <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook, Figure 3.2</a>) has mappings for entries 0 and 255.  The next
level down (L1 in <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook, Figure 3.2</a>) for entry 0 has only index 0 mapped, and the bottom-level
(L0 in <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook, Figure 3.2</a>) 
for that index 0 has entries 0, 1, and 2 mapped.

<p>
Your code might emit different physical addresses than those shown above.
The number of entries and the virtual addresses should be the same.
</p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You can put <tt>vmprint()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>.
  <li>Use the macros at the end of the file <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>.
  <li>The function <tt>freewalk()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt> should be inspirational. <tt>freewalk</tt> recursively walks through a pagetable, freeing the pages. You do not want to free pages, however, you can use the recursive algorithm for this printing. In <tt>freewalk</tt> you will see the following statement.
<pre>
uint64 child = PTE2PA(pte);
</pre>
The macro <tt>PTE2PA</tt> is defined in <tt>riscv.h</tt>, and it converts a page table entry to a physical address. <tt>PTE2PA</tt> is given by the following.
<pre>
#define PTE2PA(pte) (((pte) >> 10) << 12)

</ul>

  <li>The following is my implementation of <tt>vmprint()</tt>. It is a recursive
implementation based on the function <tt>freewalk()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>. 
It uses the macros from <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>, the <tt>%p</tt> format, and the properly
formated <tt>printf()</tt> function call.
You should place this function in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>.

call create a child process this is a duplicate of the parent process that called <tt>fork()</tt>.
The <tt>exec()</tt> function call overwrites the calling process with the program that is
an argument to <tt>exec()</tt>. When creating a new process, <tt>fork()</tt> assigns the process a unique process id (PID). The <tt>init</tt> process has PID 1. When the system is bootstrapping,

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Do not get yourself caught in the details of implementation so that you
do not understand what you have done. Think about virtual addresses, physical addresses,
page tables, page table entries, and how this 
code walks the three-level page table to print the PTEs and physical addresses.

<h2>Problem 3: Detect which pages have been accessed <script>g("moderate - partial solution code provided")</script></h2>

<p>
Some garbage collectors (a form of automatic memory management) can benefit
from information about which pages have been accessed (read or write). In this
part of the lab, you will add a new feature to xv6 that detects and reports this
information to userspace by inspecting the access bits in the RISC-V page table.
The RISC-V hardware page walker marks these bits in the PTE whenever it resolves
a TLB miss.

 <div class="required">
<p>Your job is to implement a system call, <tt>pgaccess()</tt>, that reports which
pages have been accessed. The system call takes three arguments. The first argument is
the starting virtual address of the first user page to check. The second argument is 
number of pages to check. The third argument is a user address of a 32-bit variable to store
the results into a bitmask (a datastructure that uses one bit per page and where
the first page corresponds to the least significant bit).
<p>See <a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a> for a reminder on how to 
	implement a system call.
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Read <a href="syscall.html" >Lab Syscall</a> for a review on how to add a system call.
  <li>Read <tt>pgaccess_test()</tt> in <tt>user/pgtbltest.c</tt> to
    see how the function <tt>pgaccess()</tt> is used.
  <li>You should set 32 as the maximum number of pages that can be scanned.
This allows you to pass the address of an <tt>unsigned int</tt> as the third argument.
You will see this is what <tt>user/pgtbltest.c</tt> does.
  <li>Suppose I have a <tt>char a[3*PGSIZE]</tt> that consumes three pages. 
I can call the new system call as follows.
<pre>
char a[3*PGSIZE];
unsigend int x;
... some code here that may access a ...
pgaccess(a, 3, &x);
</pre>
If <tt>a[0]</tt> has changed, bit 0 of <tt>x</tt> will be set. 
If <tt>a[4096]</tt> has changed, bit 1 of <tt>x</tt> will be set.
If <tt>a[8192]</tt> has changed, bit 2 of <tt>x</tt> will be set.
</ul>
<div class="question">
<p><b>19.</b> The above code snippet will not work in Xv6, because it defines the 
variable a as a local variable that would be allocated on the stack. 
Why will this <b>NOT</b> work on Xv6?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>20.</b> How does the function <tt>pgaccess_test()</tt> in <tt>pgtbltest.c</tt> define its variable that corresponds to <tt>a</tt>?
</div>


<ul>

  <li>Start by implementing <tt>sys_pgaccess()</tt> in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
  <li>You'll need to parse arguments using <tt>argaddr()</tt> and <tt>argint()</tt>.
  <li>For the output bitmask, it's easier to store a temporary buffer in the kernel and copy it to the user (via <tt>copyout()</tt>) after filling it with the right bits.
  <li><tt>walk()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt> is very useful for finding the right PTEs.
  <li>You'll need to define <tt>PTE_A</tt>, the access bit,
    in <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>. Consult
    the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMFDQC-and-Priv-v1.11/riscv-privileged-20190608.pdf">RISC-V
    privileged architecture manual</a> to determine its value.
<p>The following shows the page table entry bits as defined in <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>, 
along with some other lines in the file. The macro defines include how to define <tt>PTE_A</tt>.
Notice these macro definitions make use of C shifts and masks. 
These low-level C features allow us to manipulate the page table entries and virtual addresses
as defined by the RISC-V architecture.
<pre>
#define PTE_V (1L &lt;&lt; 0) // valid
#define PTE_R (1L &lt;&lt; 1)
#define PTE_W (1L &lt;&lt; 2)
#define PTE_X (1L &lt;&lt; 3)
#define PTE_U (1L &lt;&lt; 4) // user can access

<kbd>#define PTE_A (1L &lt;&lt; 6)</kbd> &leftarrow; Add this line

// shift a physical address to the right place for a PTE.
#define PA2PTE(pa) ((((uint64)pa) &gt;&gt; 12) &lt;&lt; 10)
#define PTE2PA(pte) (((pte) &gt;&gt; 10) &lt;&lt; 12)
#define PTE_FLAGS(pte) ((pte) & 0x3FF)
// extract the three 9-bit page table indices from a virtual address.
#define PXMASK          0x1FF // 9 bits
#define PXSHIFT(level)  (PGSHIFT+(9*(level)))
#define PX(level, va) ((((uint64) (va)) &gt;&gt; PXSHIFT(level)) & PXMASK)
// one beyond the highest possible virtual address.
// MAXVA is actually one bit less than the max allowed by
// Sv39, to avoid having to sign-extend virtual addresses
// that have the high bit set.
#define MAXVA (1L &lt;&lt; (9 + 9 + 9 + 12 - 1))
</pre>
  <li>Be sure to clear <tt>PTE_A</tt> after checking if it is set. Otherwise, it won't be possible to determine if the page was accessed since the last time <tt>pgaccess()</tt> was called (i.e., the bit will be set forever).
  <li>You can add the following code in the module <tt>proc.c</tt> as part of your solution. This code
implements the page access functionality. You have to create the system call portion to call this function.
There are two versions of the same code. One without line numbers that you can copy/paste. One with line numbers so I can ask questions.
<p>Version 1 - does not have line numbers.

  }

  struct proc *p = myproc();
  for(int i=0; i&lt;npage; i++){

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>We provide the user program <tt>pgtbltest.c</tt>. It tests the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> page with the <tt>pid</tt> defined in the problem and the <tt>pgaccess()</tt> system call defined in the third problem of this lab. <tt>pgtbltest</tt> has two testing functions.
<ul>
<li><tt>ugetpid_test()</tt> - This calls <tt>ugetpid()</tt> to retrieve the <tt>pid</tt> from the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> and compares it to the <tt>pid</tt> returned from the system call <tt>getpid()</tt>. The user function <tt>ugetpid()</tt> has been added to <tt>ulib.c</tt>. The code for <tt>ugetpid</tt> is the following.
<pre>
int
ugetpid(void)
{
  struct usyscall *u = (struct usyscall *)USYSCALL;
  return u->pid;
}
</pre>
<li><tt>pgaccess_test()</tt> - This uses <tt>malloc()</tt> to allocate 32 pages, and it modifies (or accesses) pages 1, 2, and 30.
The returned bits from <tt>pgaccess(buf, 32 &abits)</tt> should have bits 1, 2, and 30 set.
