<h1>Lab: page tables</h1>

<p> In this lab you will explore page tables and modify them to
  speed up certain system calls and to detect which pages have been accessed.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 3 of
  the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and related files:

  <ul>
   <li> <tt>kernel/memlayout.h</tt>, which captures the layout of memory.
	  
    <li> <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>, which contains most virtual memory (VM) code.

    <li> <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>, which contains code for allocating and
    freeing physical memory.
  
  </ul>

It may also help to consult the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMFDQC-and-Priv-v1.11/riscv-privileged-20190608.pdf">RISC-V privileged architecture manual</a>.

</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
<p>The Linux <tt>grep</tt> command can be helpful on some questions. For example, suppose a question asks you about the macro <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt>. You can discover the definition and uses of the macro <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> by issuing the following Linux <tt>grep</tt> command in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
<pre>
$ <kbd>grep TRAPFRAME *.h</kbd>
memlayout.h://   TRAPFRAME (p->trapframe, used by the trampoline)
memlayout.h:#define TRAPFRAME (TRAMPOLINE - PGSIZE)
memlayout.h:#define USYSCALL (TRAPFRAME - PGSIZE)
% <kbd>grep TRAPFRAME *.c</kbd>
proc.c:  if(mappages(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, PGSIZE,
proc.c:     uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
proc.c:  uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="required">
<p>In the directory of your xv6-labs, create two files: <b>answers-syscall.txt</b> and <b>time.txt</b> that the 
grading script looks for. You can create these files by the following:
<pre>
$ echo > answers-syscall.txt
$ echo 10 > time.txt
</pre>
I use the information in your photo files and your <b>lab-syscall-handin.txt</b> file that you submit on Canvas.
I have retained these files and this grading script approach in case I want to use it in the future.

  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout pgtbl</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>

<p>
Some operating systems (e.g., Linux) speed up certain system calls by sharing
data in a read-only region between userspace and the kernel. This eliminates the
need for kernel crossings when performing these system calls.  To help you learn
how to insert mappings into a page table, your first task is to implement this
optimization for the <tt>getpid()</tt> system call in xv6.

<div class="required">
<p>When each process is created, map one read-only page at USYSCALL (a
virtual address defined
in <tt>memlayout.h</tt>). At the start of this page, store a <tt>struct
usyscall</tt> (also defined in <tt>memlayout.h</tt>), and initialize it to store
the PID of the current process. 
This initial mapping is done in the kernel, which creates processes.
You must also map this page in the proc's pagetable.
For this lab, <tt>ugetpid()</tt> has been
provided on the userspace side and will automatically use the USYSCALL mapping.
You will receive full credit for this part of the lab if the <tt>ugetpid</tt> test
case passes when running <tt>pgtbltest</tt>.
</div>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>
  <li>The file <tt>proc.c</tt> contains functions that manipulate processes - 
      fork or create procs, allocate the procs' pagetables, exit procs,
      schedule procs, wait for a child, sleep, wakeup, etc.
      The system call <tt>fork</tt> calls the <tt>fork</tt> function in <tt>proc.c</tt>.
      The function <tt>fork</tt> calls the function <tt>allocproc</tt> to allocate a process.
      When Xv6 boots, the <tt>init</tt> process is allocated. The <tt>init</tt> 
      process <tt>fork</tt>s itself and <tt>exec</tt>s the <tt>sh</tt> program,
      which is the Xv6 shell you use in your terminal. 
      Whenever <tt>fork</tt> is called, it allocates a process, which must do such 
      things as allocate a trapframe page and establish the process's pagetable. For 
      this assignment you must update <tt>allocproc</tt> to allocate a page for the 
      process at virtual address <tt>USYSCALL</tt>, place a <tt>struct usyscall</tt> in the
      page, and assign the <tt>pid</tt> to the <tt>usyscall</tt> member <tt>int pid</tt>.
      You must also update <tt>proc_pagetable</tt> to properly map the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> address
      to the process's page table.
    <p>You should study how <tt>allocproc</tt> allocates the <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> page to get
      ideas for how to allocate the <tt>USYSCALL</tt> page.

      The file <tt>memlayout.h</tt> defines the virtual
      memory layout of the kernel with various macros such as <tt>KERNBASE</tt>,
      <tt>PHYSTOP</tt>, <tt>MAXVA</tt>, <tt>TRAMPOLINE</tt>, and <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt>. 
      The <tt>TRAMPOLINE</tt> page is mapped to the top of the virtual address space,
      and <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> is the page immediately below <tt>TRAMPOLINE</tt>.
      You can study <tt>memlayout.h</tt> as you examine Figure 3.3 of 
		  <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">our xv6 text book</a>.
  </li>	
  <li><p>As mentioned above, the file <tt>memlayout.h</tt> contains two pieces of

        <li>The macro <tt>USYSCALL</tt> is defined to be a virtual memory address that
            is one page below <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt>.

<h2>Print a page table <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>
To help you visualize RISC-V page tables, and perhaps
to aid future debugging, your second task is to write a function
that prints the contents of a page table.

<div class="required">
<p>Define a function called <tt>vmprint()</tt>.
It should take
a <tt>pagetable_t</tt> argument, and print that pagetable
in the format described below.
Insert <tt>if(p->pid==1) vmprint(p->pagetable)</tt> in
  <tt>exec.c</tt> just before the <tt>return argc</tt>,
to print the first process's page table.
  You receive full credit for this part of the lab
  if you pass the <tt>pte printout</tt> test of <tt>make grade</tt>.
  
</div>


<p>
Now when you start xv6 it should print output like this, describing
the page table of the first process at the point when it has just
finished <tt>exec()</tt>ing <tt>init</tt>:

<pre>
page table 0x0000000087f6b000
 ..0: pte 0x0000000021fd9c01 pa 0x0000000087f67000

init: starting sh
</pre>

<div class="question">
<p><b>13.</b> Why do all of the physical addresses end with three hexadecimal zeros?
</div>

The first line displays the argument to <tt>vmprint</tt>.
After that there is a line for each PTE, including PTEs that
refer to page-table pages deeper in the tree.
Each PTE line is indented by a number of <tt>" .."</tt> that indicates its
depth in the tree.
Each PTE line shows the PTE index in its page-table page, the pte bits, and the
physical address extracted from the PTE.
Don't print PTEs that are not valid.  In the above example, the
top-level page-table page (L2 in <a href="xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook, Figure 3.2</a>) has mappings for entries 0 and 255.  The next
level down (L1 in <a href="xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook, Figure 3.2</a>) for entry 0 has only index 0 mapped, and the bottom-level
(L0 in <a href="xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">Xv6 Textbook, Figure 3.2</a>) 
for that index 0 has entries 0, 1, and 2 mapped.

<p>
Your code might emit different physical addresses than those shown above.
The number of entries and the virtual addresses should be the same.
</p>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>
  <li>You can put <tt>vmprint()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>.
  <li>Use the macros at the end of the file <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>.
  <li>The function <tt>freewalk</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt> should be inspirational. <tt>freewalk</tt> recursively walks through a pagetable, freeing the pages. You do not want to free pages, however, you can use the recursive algorithm for this printing. In <tt>freewalk</tt> you will see the following statement.
<pre>
uint64 child = PTE2PA(pte);
</pre>
The macro <tt>PTE2PA</tt> is defined in <tt>riscv.h</tt>, and it converts a page table entry to a physical address. <tt>PTE2PA</tt> is given by the following.
<pre>
#define PTE2PA(pte) (((pte) >> 10) << 12)
</pre>
</ul>

<div class="question">
<p><b>14.</b> Explain how the macro <tt>PTE2PA</tt> converts a PTE into a PA.
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Define the prototype for <tt>vmprint</tt> in <tt>kernel/defs.h</tt> so
    that you can call it from exec.c.
  <li>Use <tt>%p</tt> in your printf calls to print out full 64-bit hex PTEs and addresses as shown in the example print output above.</li>
  <li><tt>printf("%d: pte %p pa %p\n", i, pagetable[i], pa);</tt> - sample <tt>printf</tt> statement with <tt>%p</tt>.
</ul>

<div class="question">
<p><b>15.</b> For every leaf page in the <tt>vmprint</tt> output, explain what it logically
contains and what its permission bits are.
Figure 3.4 in the xv6 book might be helpful, although note that the figure might
have a slightly different set of pages than the <tt>init</tt>
process that's being inspected here.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>16.</b> Xv6 does not have address space randomization. Search for this concept of address space randomization, explain it, and why is it important in today's systems?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>17.</b> Unix implementations of <tt>exec</tt> traditionally include special handling for shell scripts. If the file to execute begins with the text <tt>#!</tt>, then the first line is taken to be a program to run to interpret the file. For example, if <tt>exec</tt> is called to run <tt>myprog arg1</tt> and <tt>myprog</tt>'s first line is <tt>#!/interp</tt>, then <tt>exec</tt> runs <tt>/interp</tt> with command line <tt>/interp myprog arg1</tt>. Discuss how you would Implement support for this convention in xv6.
</div>

<!--
<div class="question">
<p><b>16. </b>The file <tt>trampoline.S</tt> has the instruction <tt>li a0, TRAPFRAME</tt>, which loads the virtual address of <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> into register <tt>a0</tt>. The RISC-V CPU that we are using has a 64-bit virtual address space, yet RISC-V has 32-bit instructions. This means it is impossible to include the virtual address of <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> in an instruction. What is happening with the <tt>li a0, TRAPFRAME</tt> instruction?
</div>
-->

<h2>Detect which pages have been accessed <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
Some garbage collectors (a form of automatic memory management) can benefit
from information about which pages have been accessed (read or write). In this
part of the lab, you will add a new feature to xv6 that detects and reports this
information to userspace by inspecting the access bits in the RISC-V page table.
The RISC-V hardware page walker marks these bits in the PTE whenever it resolves
a TLB miss.

 <div class="required">
<p>Your job is to implement a system call, <tt>pgaccess()</tt>, that reports which
pages have been accessed. The system call takes three arguments. The first argument is
the starting virtual address of the first user page to check. The second argument is 
number of pages to check. The third argument is a user address to a buffer to store
the results into a bitmask (a datastructure that uses one bit per page and where
the first page corresponds to the least significant bit). You will receive full
credit for this part of the lab if the <tt>pgaccess</tt> test case passes when
running <tt>pgtbltest</tt>.
</div>

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
  <li>Read <a href="syscall.html" >Lab Syscall</a> for a review on how to add a system call.
  <li>Read <tt>pgaccess_test()</tt> in <tt>user/pgtbltest.c</tt> to
    see how the function <tt>pgaccess()</tt> is used.
  <li>You should set 32 as the maximum number of pages that can be scanned.
This allows you to pass the address of an <tt>unsigned int</tt> as the third argument.
You will see this is what <tt>user/pgtbltest.c</tt> does.
  <li>Suppose I have a <tt>char a[3*PGSIZE]</tt> that consumes three pages. 
I can call the new system call as follows.
<pre>
char a[3*PGSIZE];
unsigend int x;
... some code here that may access a ...
pgaccess(a, 3, &x);
</pre>
If <tt>a[0]</tt> has changed, bit 0 of <tt>x</tt> will be set. 
If <tt>a[4096]</tt> has changed, bit 1 of <tt>x</tt> will be set.
If <tt>a[8192]</tt> has changed, bit 2 of <tt>x</tt> will be set.
</ul>
<div class="question">
<p><b>18.</b> The above code snippet will not work in Xv6, because it defines the 
variable a as a local variable that would be allocated on the stack. 
Why will this <b>NOT</b> work on Xv6?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>19.</b> How does the function <tt>pgaccess_test()</tt> in <tt>pgtbltest.c</tt> define its variable that corresponds to <tt>a</tt>?
</div>


<ul>

  <li>Start by implementing <tt>sys_pgaccess()</tt> in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
  <li>You'll need to parse arguments using <tt>argaddr()</tt> and <tt>argint()</tt>.
  <li>For the output bitmask, it's easier to store a temporary buffer in the kernel and copy it to the user (via <tt>copyout()</tt>) after filling it with the right bits.
  <li><tt>walk()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt> is very useful for finding the right PTEs.
  <li>You'll need to define <tt>PTE_A</tt>, the access bit,
    in <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>. Consult
    the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMFDQC-and-Priv-v1.11/riscv-privileged-20190608.pdf">RISC-V
    privileged architecture manual</a> to determine its value.
  <li>Be sure to clear <tt>PTE_A</tt> after checking if it is set. Otherwise, it won't be possible to determine if the page was accessed since the last time <tt>pgaccess()</tt> was called (i.e., the bit will be set forever).
  <li>You can use the following code in the module <tt>proc.c</tt> as part of your solution.
<pre>
 1 int
 2 pgaccess(uint64 va_start, int npage, uint64 res_addr)
 3 {
 4   if(va_start > MAXVA) {
 5     panic("pgaccess: too large VA");

which will generate <tt>lab.zip</tt>.
Upload this zip file to the corresponding Gradescope assignment.

<p> If you run <kbd>make zipball</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked, i.e., not listed in a line that begins with <tt>??</tt>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<kbd>git add {filename}</kbd>.
</p>

<div class="warning">
<ul>
  <li>Please run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to ensure that your code passes all of the tests.
    The Gradescope autograder will use the same grading program to assign your submission a grade.</li>
  <li>Commit any modified source code before running <kbd>make zipball</kbd>.</li>
  <li>You can inspect the status of your submission and download the submitted
    code at Gradescope. The Gradescope lab grade is your final lab grade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Use super-pages to reduce the number of PTEs in page tables.

  <li>Unmap the first page of a user process so that dereferencing a
  null pointer will result in a fault.  You will have to
  change <tt>user.ld</tt> to start the user text segment at, for
  example, 4096, instead of 0.

  <li>Add a system call that reports dirty pages (modified pages) using <tt>PTE_D</tt>.
