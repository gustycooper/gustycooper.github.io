<h1>Lab: file system</h1>

<p>In this lab you will add large files and symbolic links to the xv6
  file system.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before writing code, you should read "Chapter 8:
  File system" from the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6
  book</a> and study the corresponding code.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
<p>The Linux <tt>grep</tt> command can be helpful on some questions. For example, suppose a question asks you about the <tt>struct proc</tt>. You can discover the definition and uses of the <tt>struct proc</tt> by issuing the following Linux <tt>grep</tt> command in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
<pre>
$ <kbd>grep inode *.h</kbd>
defs.h:struct inode;
defs.h:int             dirlink(struct inode*, char*, uint);
defs.h:struct inode*   dirlookup(struct inode*, char*, uint*);
... lots of matches
fs.h:#define IBLOCK(i, sb)     ((i) / IPB + sb.inodestart)
proc.h:  struct inode *cwd;           // Current directory
% <kbd>grep inode *.c</kbd>
exec.c:static int loadseg(pde_t *, uint64, struct inode *, uint, uint);
exec.c:  struct inode *ip;
exec.c:loadseg(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 va, struct inode *ip, uint offset, uint sz)
... lots of matches
sysfile.c:  struct inode *ip;
sysfile.c:  struct inode *ip;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="required">
<p>In the directory of your xv6-labs, create two files: <b>answers-fs.txt</b> and <b>time.txt</b> that the 
grading script looks for. You can create these files by the following:
<pre>
$ echo > answers-fs.txt
$ echo 10 > time.txt
</pre>
I use the information in your photo files and your <b>lab-fs-handin.txt</b> file that you submit on Canvas.
I have retained these files and this grading script approach in case I want to use it in the future.

</div>

<h2>Large files <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this assignment you'll increase the maximum size of an xv6
file. Currently xv6 files are limited to 268 blocks, or 268*BSIZE
bytes (BSIZE is 1024 in xv6). This limit comes from the fact that an
xv6 inode contains 12 "direct" block numbers and one "singly-indirect"
block number, which refers to a block that holds up to 256 more block
  numbers, for a total of 12+256=268 blocks.

<p>The <tt>bigfile</tt> command creates the longest file it can,
and reports that size:
<pre>
$ bigfile
..
wrote 268 blocks
bigfile: file is too small
$
</pre>
The test fails because <tt>bigfile</tt> expects to be able
to create a file with 65803 blocks, but unmodified xv6 limits
files to 268 blocks.

<p>You'll change the xv6 file system code to support a
"doubly-indirect" block in each inode, containing 256 addresses of
singly-indirect blocks, each of which can contain up to 256 addresses
of data blocks. The result will be that a file will be able to consist
of up to 65803 blocks, or 256*256+256+11 blocks (11 instead of 12, because we will
sacrifice one of the direct block numbers for the double-indirect
block).

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

The <tt>mkfs</tt> program creates the xv6 file system disk image
and determines
how many total blocks the file system has; this size is controlled by
<tt>FSSIZE</tt> in <tt>kernel/param.h</tt>.
You'll see that <tt>FSSIZE</tt> in the repository for
this lab is set to
200,000 blocks.  You should see the following output from <tt>mkfs/mkfs</tt>
in the make output:
<pre>
nmeta 70 (boot, super, log blocks 30 inode blocks 13, bitmap blocks 25) blocks 199930 total 200000
</pre>
This line describes the file system that <tt>mkfs/mkfs</tt> built: it
has 70 meta-data blocks (blocks used to describe the file system) and
199,930 data blocks, totaling 200,000 blocks.
<br>
If at any point during the lab you find yourself having to rebuild the file system from scratch, you
can run <tt>make clean</tt> which forces make to rebuild fs.img.

<h3>What to Look At</h3>

The format of an on-disk inode is defined by <tt>struct dinode</tt>
in <tt>fs.h</tt>. You're particularly interested in <tt>NDIRECT</tt>,
<tt>NINDIRECT</tt>, <tt>MAXFILE</tt>, and the <tt>addrs[]</tt> element
of <tt>struct dinode</tt>. The following figure is an updated version
of Figure 8-3 in the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>. 
It shows a dinode with 
direct, singly-indirect, and doubly-indirect blocks. 
You should compare this diagarm with Figure 8-3. You should notice
that the size of a <tt>struct dinode</tt> did not change. The <tt>dinode</tt>
in Figure 8-3 has 12 direct addresses and one singly-indirect. The <tt>dinode</tt>
in the following figure has 11 direct addresses, one singly-indirect, and
one doubly-indirect.
<p>If you understand
this diagram, you are well on the way to solving this problem. <br>

<!-- <img src="dinode.jpg" alt="Disk IO" width="500" height="600"> -->
<!-- <img src="dinode.jpg" alt="Disk IO" > -->
<img src="dinode.png" alt="Disk IO" >

<p>
The code that finds a file's data on disk is in <tt>bmap()</tt>
in <tt>fs.c</tt>. Have a look at it and make sure you understand
what it's doing. <tt>bmap()</tt> is called both when reading and
writing a file. When writing, <tt>bmap()</tt> allocates new
blocks as needed to hold file content, as well as allocating
an indirect block if needed to hold block addresses.

<p>
<tt>bmap()</tt> deals with two kinds of block numbers. The <tt>bn</tt>
argument is a "logical block number" -- a block number within the file,
relative to the start
of the file. The block numbers in <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt>, and the
argument to <tt>bread()</tt>, are disk block numbers.
You can view <tt>bmap()</tt> as mapping a file's logical
block numbers into disk block numbers.

<h3>Your Job</h3>

<div class="required">
Modify <tt>bmap()</tt> so that it implements a doubly-indirect block,
in addition to direct blocks and a singly-indirect block.  You'll have
to have only 11 direct blocks, rather than 12, to make room for your
new doubly-indirect block; you're not allowed to change the size of an
on-disk inode.  The first 11 elements of <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt> should
be direct blocks; the 12th should be a singly-indirect block (just
like the current one); the 13th should be your new doubly-indirect
block. You are done with this exercise when <tt>bigfile</tt> writes
65803 blocks and <tt>usertests -q</tt> runs successfully:
</div>

<pre>
$ <kbd>bigfile</kbd>
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
wrote 65803 blocks
done; ok
$ usertests -q
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
</pre>

<p>
<tt>bigfile</tt> will take at least a minute and a half to run.

<p>Hints:

<ul>

<li>The file <tt>kernel/fs.c</tt> contains the functions you must update. The functions
are <tt>bmap()</tt> and <tt>itrunc()</tt>.

<li>The file <tt>kernel/fs.h</tt> has been provided for you. The file system
definition of a <tt>struct dinode</tt> has be updated to reflect the diagram provided above.	
Also, the macro defintion of <tt>NDIRECT</tt> has been updated. Since the number of
direct address has been reduced do 11, the <tt>NDIRECT</tt> macro defines it to be 11.

<li>The function <tt>bmap()</tt> uses a variable named <tt>ip</tt>, which stands
for <i>inode pointer</i>. The definition is <br>
<tt>struct inode *ip</tt>
    
<li> Make sure you understand <tt>bmap()</tt>. Write out a diagram of the
relationships between <tt>ip->addrs[]</tt>, the indirect block, the
doubly-indirect block and the singly-indirect blocks it points to, and
data blocks. Make sure you understand why adding a doubly-indirect
block increases the maximum file size by 256*256 blocks (really -1,
since you have to decrease the number of direct blocks by one).

<li>
Think about how you'll index the doubly-indirect block, and
the indirect blocks it points to, with the logical block
number.

<li>You will see that the <tt>kernel/fs.h</tt> provided changed the definition of 
<tt>NDIRECT</tt> to be 11. It was previously 12. This change required 
changing the declaration of <tt>addrs[]</tt> to be <br>
<tt>uint addrs[NDIRECT+2];   // Data block addresses</tt>

<li>The definition of <tt>struct inode</tt> in <tt>file.h</tt> also uses
the macro <tt>NDIRECT</tt> for its <tt>addrs[]</tt> array. 
You must update <tt>file.h</tt>'s definition of <tt>struct inode</tt> and <tt>addrs[]</tt>
to match that of <tt>fs.h</tt>'s definition of <tt>struct dinode</tt> and <tt>addrs[]</tt>.

<li>Since the definition of <tt>NDIRECT</tt> has been changed, make sure to create a
new <tt>fs.img</tt>, since <tt>mkfs</tt> uses <tt>NDIRECT</tt> to build the
file system.  

<li>If your file system gets into a bad state, perhaps by crashing,
delete <tt>fs.img</tt> (do this from Unix, not xv6).  <tt>make</tt> will build a
new clean file system image for you.

<li>Don't forget to <tt>brelse()</tt> each block that you
<tt>bread()</tt>.

<li>You should allocate indirect blocks and doubly-indirect
  blocks only as needed, like the original <tt>bmap()</tt>.

<li>Make sure <tt>itrunc</tt> frees all blocks of a file, including
  double-indirect blocks.

<li><tt>usertests</tt> takes longer to run than in previous labs
  because for this lab <tt>FSSIZE</tt> is larger and big files are
  larger.

</ul>


<h2>Symbolic links <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>In this exercise you will add symbolic links to xv6.  Symbolic
links (or soft links) refer to a linked file by pathname; when a
symbolic link is opened, the kernel follows the link to the referred
file.  Symbolic links resembles hard links, but hard links are
restricted to pointing to file on the same disk, while symbolic links
can cross disk devices.  Although xv6 doesn't support multiple
devices, implementing this system call is a good exercise to
understand how pathname lookup works.

<h3>Your job</h3>

<div class="required">
<p>Originally, you were to implement the <tt>symlink(char *target, char *path)</tt>
system call, which creates a new symbolic link at path that refers
to file named by target. Implementing this is rather difficult.
Thus, I have modified this portion of the lab.
<ol>
<li>Explain soft and hard links. How are they different? How are hard links implementd?
<p>
For further information about links (both symbolic/soft and hard links), you can search the Internet or refer to 
the man pages for <tt>link</tt> and <tt>symlink</tt>.  
When performing your background study be sure to study the differences between soft and hard links.
<li>This lab has a symbolic link test program - <tt>user/syblinktest.c</tt>, which was intended to test your implemenation of symbolic links. 
Instead, you will study <tt>user/symlinktest.c</tt> and document your understanding. 
<p>In the file <tt>user/symlinktest.c</tt>, explain the functions <tt>testsymlink()</tt> and <tt>stat_slink()</tt>.
<li>Create a design for symbolic links. Design the <tt>symlink()</tt> system call that creates a symbolic link and <tt>open()</tt> that opens a symbolic link.  Your <tt>open()</tt> design has to traverse two symlinks. 
<p> In your design, you can create/use functions such as the following:
<ul>
<li><tt>ialloc()</tt> - allocate and return an inode.
<li><tt>nameiparent()</tt> - return the inode of a parent. For example, nameiparent("dir/file") returns the inode of dir.
<li><tt>dirlookup(inode, name)</tt> - return the inode of file "name" in the directory "inode"
<li><tt>iupdate(ip)</tt> - update the inode.
</ul>
<p>For example, <tt>$ echo gusty > file</tt> can be designed as follows. You can create other functions.
<ol type="A">
<li><tt>ialloc()</tt> an inode for <tt>file</tt>.
<li><tt>balloc()</tt> a data block for <tt>file</tt>.
<li>Add the data block to <tt>file</tt>'s inode.
<li>Write the string <tt>gusty</tt> to the data block.
<li>Update the size in <tt>file</tt>'s inode.
<li>Add the directory entry <tt>file</tt> and inode to the current working directory.
</ol>
</ol>

$ usertests -q
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
</pre>
 
<p>Hints:

<ul>

<li> First, create a new system call number for symlink, add an entry
to user/usys.pl, user/user.h, and implement an empty sys_symlink in kernel/sysfile.c.

<li>Add a new file type (<tt>T_SYMLINK</tt>) to kernel/stat.h to
represent a symbolic link.

<li> Add a new flag to kernel/fcntl.h, (<tt>O_NOFOLLOW</tt>), that can
be used with the <tt>open</tt> system call. Note that flags passed to
<tt>open</tt> are combined using a bitwise OR operator, so your new
flag should not overlap with any existing flags. This will let you
compile user/symlinktest.c once you add it to the Makefile.

<li>Implement the <tt>symlink(target, path)</tt> system call to create
a new symbolic link at path that refers to target. Note that target
does not need to exist for the system call to succeed. You will need
to choose somewhere to store the target path of a symbolic link, for
example, in the inode's data blocks. <tt>symlink</tt> should return an integer
representing success (0) or failure (-1) similar to <tt>link</tt> and <tt>unlink</tt>.

<li>Modify the <tt>open</tt> system call to handle the case where the path
refers to a symbolic link. If the file does not exist, <tt>open</tt>
must fail.  When a process specifies <tt>O_NOFOLLOW</tt> in the flags
to <tt>open</tt>, <tt>open</tt> should open the symlink (and not
follow the symbolic link).

<li>If the linked file is also a symbolic link, you must recursively
follow it until a non-link file is reached. If the links form a cycle,
you must return an error code. You may approximate this by returning
an error code if the depth of links reaches some threshold (e.g., 10).

<li> Other system calls (e.g., link and unlink) must not
  follow symbolic links; these system calls operate on the symbolic
  link itself.

<li>You do not have to handle symbolic links to directories for this
lab.
