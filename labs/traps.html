<h1>Lab: traps</h1>

<p>This lab explores how system calls are implemented using traps.
  You will first do a warm-up exercises with stacks and then you will
  implement an example of user-level trap handling.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you begin the traps lab, read Chapter 4 of the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and
    related source files:
  
  <ul>

    <li> <tt>kernel/trampoline.S</tt>: the assembly involved in
      changing from user space to kernel space and back
      
    <li> <tt>kernel/trap.c</tt>: code handling all interrupts
  
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
<p>The Linux <tt>grep</tt> command can be helpful on some questions. For example, suppose a question asks you about the macro <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt>. You can discover the definition and uses of the macro <tt>TRAPFRAME</tt> by issuing the following Linux <tt>grep</tt> command in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
<pre>
$ <kbd>grep TRAPFRAME *.h</kbd>
memlayout.h://   TRAPFRAME (p->trapframe, used by the trampoline)
memlayout.h:#define TRAPFRAME (TRAMPOLINE - PGSIZE)
memlayout.h:#define USYSCALL (TRAPFRAME - PGSIZE)
% <kbd>grep TRAPFRAME *.c</kbd>
proc.c:  if(mappages(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, PGSIZE,
proc.c:     uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
proc.c:  uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="required">
<p>In the directory of your xv6-labs, create two files: <b>answers-traps.txt</b> and <b>time.txt</b> that I may use 
if I run your code using your zip file submission. The answers-traps.txt is a blank file. The time.txt file contains
the number of hours you spent on the lab.

<h2>RISC-V assembly <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>It will be important to understand a bit of
  RISC-V assembly. You were exposed to ARM assembly in CPSC 305. 
  RISC-V and ARM are both Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC).
  Recall that attributes of RISC architectures are
<ul>
<li> Load/store architecture. All memory is accessed with loads (move memory to registers)
and stores (more registers to memory). Arithmetic and logic instructions operate on registers.
<li> Many registers.
<li> All instructions are the same size. Both RISC-V and ARM have 32-bit instructions.
<li> Single clock simple instructions.
<li> Easier to pipeline.
</ul>
<p>Moving from ARM to RISC-V is rather straightforward especially since we do not have
to become expert assembly programmers for the course. 
  There is a file
  <tt>user/call.c</tt> in your xv6 repo.  <kbd>make fs.img</kbd> compiles it
  and also produces a readable assembly version of the program in
  <tt>user/call.asm</tt>.
<p>The C code for <tt>user/call.c</tt> is the following.
<pre>
int g(int x) {
  return x+3;
}

int f(int x) {
  return g(x);
}

void main(void) {
  printf("%d %d\n", f(8)+1, 13);
  exit(0);
}
</pre>

<p>Read the code in <tt>call.asm</tt> for the functions <tt>g</tt>, <tt>f</tt>, and <tt>main</tt>.
  The instruction
  manual for RISC-V is on the <a href="../reference.html">reference page</a>, if you need it.
  Answer the following questions in notebook.

  <div class="question">
    <b>1.</b> Which registers contain arguments to functions?  For example, which
    register holds 13 in main's call to <tt>printf</tt>?
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">
    <b>2.</b> Where is the call to function <tt>f</tt>
    in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to <tt>g</tt>?  (Hint: the
    compiler may inline functions.)
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">
    <b>3.</b> At what address is the
    function <tt>printf</tt> located?
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <b>4.</b> What value is in the register <tt>ra</tt>
    just after the <tt>jalr</tt> to <tt>printf</tt> in <tt>main</tt>?
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <b>5.</b> Run the following code on Xv6. 
You will have to create a user program and add it to UPROGS in the Makefile.
<p><b>Include the running of your program in your <tt>lab-traps-handin.txt</tt></b>.
      <pre>
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &amp;i);
      </pre>
      What is the output?
      <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">Here's an ASCII
	table</a> that maps bytes to characters.

    <p>The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is
      little-endian.  If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would
      you set <code>i</code> to in order to yield the same output?
      Would you need to change
      <code>57616</code> to a different value?</p>

    <p>

  <h2>Backtrace <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

 <p>For debugging it is often useful to have a backtrace: a list
    of the function calls on the stack above the point
    at which the error occurred.
  To help with backtraces, the compiler generates machine code that maintains a stack
  frame on the stack corresponding to each function in the
  current call chain. Each stack frame contains of the return
  address,  "saved frame pointer", saved registers, and local variables. 
  The "saved frame pointer" points to the caller's stack frame, which has a
  "saved frame pointer" that points to its caller's stack frame. Register
  <tt>s0</tt> contains a pointer to the current stack frame
  (it actually points to the the address of the saved return address
  on the stack plus 8).  Your <tt>backtrace</tt>
  should begin with the value in <tt>s0</tt>, walk up the stack, and print the
  saved return address (ra) in each stack frame.

<div class="required">
<p>
  Implement a <tt>backtrace()</tt> function
  in <tt>kernel/printf.c</tt>.  Insert a call to this function
  in <tt>sys_sleep</tt>, and then run <kbd>bttest</kbd>, which
  calls <tt>sys_sleep</tt>.
  You will have to add a <tt>backtrace</tt> function prototype in <tt>defs.h</tt>.
  Your output should be a list of return addresses with this form (but the numbers will likely be different):
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>bttest</kbd>
    0x00000000800021f2
    0x0000000080002064
    0x0000000080001d26
  </pre>
  The Linux program <tt>addr2line</tt> translates an address to a filename and line number using a file that has debug information in it. The file <tt>kernel/kernel</tt> has the Xv6 kernel's executable and debug information. <tt>addr2line</tt> reads addresses as input from standard input until you enter Ctrl-D.
You can enter addresses one at a time, or copy/paste all three.
<p> 
  After <tt>bttest</tt> exit qemu. In a terminal window: 
  run <tt>riscv64-linux-gnu-addr2line -e kernel/kernel</tt> (or <tt>riscv64-unknown-elf-addr2line -e kernel/kernel</tt>) and cut-and-paste the addresses from your backtrace, entering one address at a time, like this:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>riscv64-linux-gnu-addr2line -e kernel/kernel</kbd>
    0x00000000800021f2
    /home/faculty/ecooper/gustyx/kernel/sysproc.c:71
    0x0000000080002064
    /home/faculty/ecooper/gustyx/kernel/syscall.c:145
    0x0000000080001d26
    /home/faculty/ecooper/gustyx/kernel/trap.c:76
  </pre>
Or you can copy/paste all three like this:
   <pre>
    $ <kbd>riscv64-linux-gnu-addr2line -e kernel/kernel</kbd>
    0x00000000800021f2
    0x0000000080002064
    0x0000000080001d26
    Ctrl-D
  </pre>
  You should see something like this:
  <pre>
    kernel/sysproc.c:71
    kernel/syscall.c:145
    kernel/trap.c:67
  </pre>
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
 <ul>
 <li> The following diagram shows a layout of stack frames. 
 Note that the return address lives at a fixed offset (-8) from the frame pointer of a
 stackframe, and that the saved frame pointer lives at fixed offset (-16) from the frame pointer. <br>
<img src="backtrace.png" alt="Stack Frames" >
<!--
 <li>These
 <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/lec/l-riscv.txt">lecture
 notes</a> have a picture of the layout of stack frames. 
-->
 <li>Recall that a stack frame grows from high memory to low memory. Everytime a function
 is called, the function entry sequence allocates the stack by subtracting from the stack pointer
 to allocate enough space for (1) local variables, (2) any registers the function will overwrite,
 (3) the previous (saved) frame pointer, and (4) the return address.
 <li>When the function returns, the stack frame is deallocated.
 <li>Consider the function entry sequence for a simple add function with prototype: <br>
<tt>int add(int a, int b)</tt>.
<pre>
add:
                  # <b>prologue or entry sequence</b>
  addi sp,sp,-32  # allocate 32 byte stack
  sd   ra,24(sp)  # put ra on stack
  sd   s0,16(sp)  # put previous fp on stack
  addi s0,sp,32   # create current fp
  mv   a5,a0      # param a is in a0
  mv   a4,a1      # param b is in a1
  sw   a5,-20(s0) # put a on stack
  mv   a5,a4      # put b into a5
  sw   a5,-24(s0) # put b on stack
-----------------------------------------
                  # <b>function body</b>
  lw   a5,-20(s0) # get a from stack
  mv   a4,a5
  lw   a5,-24(s0)
... more code ...
-----------------------------------------
                  # <b>epilogue or exit sequence</b>
  mv   a0,a5      # put return value in a0
  ld   ra,24(sp)  # get ra from stack

  <div class="question">
    <b>9.</b> What is the size (in bytes) of the allocated stack?

  <div class="question">

 <li>The GCC compiler stores the frame pointer of the currently
 executing function in the
 register <tt>s0</tt>. Add the following function
 to <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>:
 <pre>
static inline uint64
r_fp()
{
  uint64 x;
  asm volatile("mv %0, s0" : "=r" (x) );
  return x;
}
</pre>
 and call this function in <tt>backtrace</tt> to read the current frame pointer.  <tt>r_fp()</tt> uses <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Using-Assembly-Language-with-C.html">in-line
 assembly</a> to read <tt>s0</tt>.
After reading <tt>s0</tt>, <tt>r_fp()</tt> returns its value.
  <div class="question">
    <b>13.</b> The function <tt>r_fp()</tt> is a C function, but it contains assembly code. How does the C programming
    language allow this?
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">
    <b>14.</b> What is the purpose of the <tt>volatile</tt> keyword?
  </div>
  
 <li>Your <tt>backtrace</tt> function can call <tt>r_fp()</tt> as follows.<br>
<pre>
uint64 fp = r_fp();
</pre>
  The variable <tt>fp</tt> contains a 64-bit address which points to the current stack frame.
  Using C pointers, you can access the return address and the previous frame pointer as follows.
<pre>
uint64 ra  = *(uint64*)(fp - 8);
uint64 pfp = *(uint64*)(fp - 16);
</pre>
 <li>Your <tt>backtrace()</tt> will need a way to recognize that
 it has seen the last stack frame, and should stop.
 A useful fact is that the memory allocated for each kernel
 stack consists of a single page-aligned page,
 so that all the stack frames for a given stack
 are on the same page.
 You can use
 <tt>PGROUNDDOWN(fp)</tt>
 (see <tt>kernel/riscv.h</tt>) to identify the
 page that a frame pointer refers to.
 The following shows initializing a frame pointer variable, and a while loop that terminates.
<pre>
  uint64 fp = r_fp();
  while(fp != PGROUNDDOWN(fp)){
    ...
  }
</pre>

 <li>Add the prototype for your <tt>backtrace()</tt> to <tt>kernel/defs.h</tt> so that
  you can call <tt>backtrace</tt> in <tt>sys_sleep</tt>.
 <li>Implement your <tt>backtrace()</tt> function
  in <tt>kernel/printf.c</tt>.  
 <li>Insert a call to your <tt>backtrace()</tt> 
  in <tt>sys_sleep</tt>.
 <li>After implementing your <tt>backtrace()</tt>, run <kbd>bttest</kbd>, which
  calls <tt>sys_sleep</tt>.
 </ul>

<p>Once your backtrace is working, call it from <tt>panic</tt>
  in <tt>kernel/printf.c</tt> so that you see the kernel's backtrace
  when it panics.

<h2>Alarm <script>g("hard")</script></h2>

<div class="warning">
<p>
<b>You do not have to implement this solution, but you must answer the questions.</b>
</div>
<div class="required">
<p>
In this exercise you'll add a feature to xv6 that periodically alerts
a process as it uses CPU time. This might be useful for compute-bound
processes that want to limit how much CPU time they chew up, or for
processes that want to compute but also want to take some periodic
action. More generally, you'll be implementing a primitive form of
user-level interrupt/fault handlers; you could use something similar
to handle page faults in the application, for example.  Your solution
is correct if it passes <tt>alarmtest</tt> and <tt>usertests -q</tt>.
</div>

<p>
You should add two new system calls: (1) <tt>sigalarm(interval, handler)</tt> system call.
and (2) <tt>sigreturn()</tt> system call.
If an application calls <tt>sigalarm(n, fn)</tt>, then after every
<tt>n</tt> "ticks" of CPU time that the program consumes, the kernel
should cause application function
<tt>fn()</tt> to be called. When <tt>fn()</tt> calls <tt>sigreturn()</tt>, the application
should resume where it left off. The last statement in the function <tt>fn()</tt> will
be a call to <tt>sigreturn()</tt>.
<p>A tick is a fairly arbitrary unit of
time in xv6, determined by how often a hardware timer generates
interrupts.
If an application calls <tt>sigalarm(0, 0)</tt>, the kernel should
stop generating periodic alarm calls.

<p>The following shows my implementation of the two system calls.
<pre>
uint64
sys_sigalarm(void)
{
  struct proc* p = myproc();
  argint(0, &p->interval);
  argaddr(1, &p->handler);
  p->regs = p->trapframe + sizeof(struct trapframe);
  return 0;
}

uint64
sys_sigreturn(void){
  struct proc* p = myproc();
  memmove(p->trapframe, p->regs, sizeof(struct trapframe));
  p->ticks = 0;
  return p->trapframe->a0;
}
</pre>

  <div class="question">
    <b>15.</b> Describe the three members added to the <tt>struct proc</tt> that are used by
    this implementation of the <tt>sigalarm</tt> and <tt>sigreturn</tt> system calls.
  </div>
  
<p>
You'll find a file <tt>user/alarmtest.c</tt> in your xv6
repository. Add it to the Makefile. It won't compile correctly
until you've added <tt>sigalarm</tt> and <tt>sigreturn</tt>
system calls (see below).

<p>
<tt>alarmtest</tt> calls <tt>sigalarm(2, periodic)</tt>
in <tt>test0</tt> to ask the kernel to force a call
to <tt>periodic()</tt> every 2 ticks, and then spins for a while.  You
can see the assembly code for alarmtest in user/alarmtest.asm, which
may be handy for debugging.  Your solution is correct when
<tt>alarmtest</tt> produces output like this and usertests -q also runs
correctly:

<pre>
$ <kbd>alarmtest</kbd>

<p>When you're done, your solution will be only a few lines of code,
  but it may be tricky to get it right. We'll test your code with the
  version of alarmtest.c in the original repository. You can modify
  alarmtest.c to help you debug, but make sure the original alarmtest
  says that all the tests pass.

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Since <tt>sigalarm</tt> and <tt>sigreturn</tt> are system calls,
      you can reviews to steps for adding system calls at  
      <a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a>.
    <li>Your solution will require you to save and restore
      registers---what registers do you need to save and restore to resume
      the interrupted code correctly? (Hint: it will be many).
    <li>Have <tt>usertrap</tt> save enough state in
      <tt>struct proc</tt> when the timer goes off
      that <tt>sigreturn</tt> can correctly return to the
      interrupted user code.

    <li>Prevent re-entrant calls to the handler----if a handler hasn't
      returned yet, the kernel shouldn't call it again. <tt>test2</tt>
      tests this.

    <li>Make sure to restore a0.  <tt>sigreturn</tt> is a system call,
      and its return value is stored in a0.
      
  </ul>

  <div class="question">
    <b>17.</b> The current code in <tt>usertrap()</tt> for a timer interrupt is the following.
<pre>
  // give up the CPU if this is a timer interrupt.
  if(which_dev == 2)
    yield();
</pre>
<p>
Design the algorithm that will call the signal handler when the selected number of ticks has expired.
<p>
This requires some thought. You must examine the <tt>struct proc</tt> member <tt>ticks</tt> to see if
it equal to the interval. If it is, what do you do? You do not call a function, because this is a 
timer interrupt. How do you manipulate the trap frame such that the <tt>sigalarm()</tt> handler is called?
<p>
If you study the remainder of this problem specification, you will get lots of clues as to how to design this.
  </div>


<h4>Step 1: invoke handler</h4>
<p>You want to first make sure the kernel can successfully jump to the
alarm handler in user space. Modify the kernel to have a working <tt>sigalarm</tt> and
a simplified <tt>sigreturn</tt>  You can use <tt>test0</tt> of <tt>alarmtest</tt> 
to test your changes. The alarm handler is <tt>test0</tt> will print <tt>alarm!</tt>
when it is called.
Don't worry yet
what happens after the "alarm!" output; it's OK for now if your
program crashes after printing "alarm!". At this point, you just want the kernel
to call the alarm handler. Here are some hints:

<ul>
<li><tt>test0</tt> of <tt>alarmtest</tt> calls <tt>sigalarm</tt> to see if its
alarm handler is properly called. You can examine <tt>test0</tt> to see the 
the details of the following, which is a mixture of code and psuedo code.
<pre>
volatile static int count;

void periodic() { // test0 alarm handler
  count = count + 1;
  printf("alarm!\n");
  sigreturn();
}

void test0() {
  count = 0;
  sigalarm(2, periodic);
  loop long enough for 2 ticks {
    if (count > 0)
      break;
  }
  sigalarm(0, 0); // turn off alarms
  if (count > 0)
    printf("test0 passed\n");
}

</pre>


<li>You must to modify the <tt>Makefile</tt> to cause <tt>alarmtest.c</tt>
to be compiled as an xv6 user program. Recall this is done by adding
<tt>$U/_alarmtest\</tt> to <tt>UPROGS</tt>.


<li>You must put the function prototypes for <tt>sigalarm</tt> and <tt>sigreturn</tt>
in <tt>user/user.h</tt>.
<pre>
    int sigalarm(int ticks, void (*handler)());
    int sigreturn(void);
</pre>

<li>You must update <tt>user/usys.pl</tt> (which generates <tt>user/usys.S</tt>),
   <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>, and <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt> 
   to allow <tt>alarmtest</tt> to invoke the <tt>sigalarm</tt> and
   <tt>sigreturn</tt> system calls. Please review 
      <a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a>
   if you need a refresher on adding system calls to Xv6.

<li>For now, your <tt>sys_sigreturn</tt> should just return zero.

<li>Your <tt>sys_sigalarm()</tt> should store the alarm interval and
the pointer to the handler function in new fields in the <tt>proc</tt>
structure (in <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt>). These fields can be
<pre>
int interval;               // alarm interval
uint64 handler;             // pointer to the handler function
</pre>

<li>You'll need to keep track of how many ticks have passed since the
last call (or are left until the next call) to a process's alarm
handler; you'll need a new field in <tt>struct&nbsp;proc</tt> for this
too. This field can be
<pre>
int ticks;                  // ticks have passed since the last call
</pre> 

<li>You can initialize the new <tt>proc</tt> fields to 0 in <tt>allocproc()</tt>
in <tt>proc.c</tt>.

<li>Every tick, the hardware clock forces an interrupt, which is handled
in <tt>usertrap()</tt> in <tt>kernel/trap.c</tt>. This is where you will update
the field <tt>ticks</tt>.

<li>The function <tt>usertrap()</tt> is called for timer interrupts and
device interrupts. The variable <tt>which_dev</tt> indicates the interrupt type.
<tt>which_dev</tt> is a 2 for timer interrupts. 
You only want to manipulate a process's alarm ticks if there's a 
timer interrupt; you want something like
<pre>
    if(which_dev == 2) ...
</pre>

<li>Only invoke the alarm function if the process has a
  timer outstanding.  Note that the address of the user's alarm
  function might be 0 (e.g., in user/alarmtest.asm, <tt>periodic</tt> is at
  address 0). This means you cannot us a nonzero compare on the <tt>proc</tt>
  field <tt>handler</tt> to determine if the the process has a timer
  outstanding. You must use a nonzero compare to the field <tt>interval</tt>
  to determine if the process has a timer outstanding.

 <li>You'll need to modify
  <tt>usertrap()</tt> so that when a
  process's alarm interval expires, the user process executes
  the handler function.
<li>The trapframe contains the user space return address in the field <tt>epc</tt>.
When a trap occurs the PC value that was interrupted in placed in the <tt>sepc</tt> register.
In the case of a system call, the value in <tt>sepc</tt> is the addres of the <tt>ecall</tt>
instruction. When returning to user space following a system call, the kernel must
return to <tt>sepc+4</tt>. <tt>usertrap()</tt> has code that accomplishes the following. 
<pre>
p->trapframe->epc = r_sepc() + 4;
</pre>
<tt>r_sepc()</tt> is in <tt>riscv.h</tt>, and it has an assembly macro that reads to 
<tt>sepc</tt> register. At the beginning of this lab, you added <tt>r_fp()</tt> to 
<tt>riskv.h</tt> to read the frame pointer. 

  <div class="question">
    <b>18.</b> The actual code in <tt>usertrap()</tt> is different than the above line that adds 4 to
    <tt>r_sepc()</tt>.
    How does the <tt>usertrap()</tt> code accomplish adding 4 to the <tt>sepc</tt> register?
  </div>
  
<li>In the case where a timer interrupt must return to the process' handler, you must put
the handler's address in <tt>p->trapframe->epc</tt>. The pseudo code in <tt>usertrap</tt>
looks like the following. Then instead of returning to the instruction after the
system call, the return is to the process' handler.
<pre>
if (this is a timer interrupt) {
  if (this proc has a handler) {
    increment ticks
    if (tick == interval)
      p->trapframe->epc = p->handler
  }
</pre>

  <div class="question">
    <b>19.</b> How does <tt>usertrap()</tt> determine if the trap is a syscall?
  </div>

<li>It will be easier to look at traps with gdb if you tell qemu to
use only one CPU, which you can do by running
<pre>
    make CPUS=1 qemu-gdb
</pre>

<li>You've succeeded if alarmtest prints "alarm!".

</ul>
  <div class="question">
    <b>20.</b> Several parts to this question.
<p><b>A. </b> What code executes initially when a trap/interrupt occurs?
<p><b>B. </b> What mode is the CPU in when it executes the trap handling code?
<p><b>C. </b> What page table is used when a trap/interrupt initially occurs?
<p><b>D. </b> What does the sfence RISC-V instruction do, and where is it used in the trap processing?

  </div>


<h4>test1/test2()/test3(): resume interrupted code</h4>

<ul>
<li>Chances are that alarmtest crashes in test0 or test1 after it prints
"alarm!", or that alarmtest (eventually) prints "test1 failed",
or that alarmtest exits without printing "test1 passed".
To fix this, you must
ensure that, when the alarm handler is done,
control returns to
the instruction at which the user program was originally
interrupted by the timer interrupt. You must ensure that
the register contents are restored to the values they held
at the time of the interrupt, so that the user program
can continue undisturbed after the alarm.
Finally,
you should "re-arm" the alarm counter after each time it goes
off, so that the handler is called periodically.

<li>As a starting point, we've made a design decision for you:
user alarm handlers are required to call the <tt>sigreturn</tt>
system call when they have finished. Have a look at
<tt>periodic</tt> in <tt>alarmtest.c</tt> for an example.
This means that you can add code to <tt>usertrap</tt> and
<tt>sys_sigreturn</tt> that cooperate to cause the user
process to resume properly after it has handled the alarm.

</ul>



<p>Once you pass <tt>test0</tt>, <tt>test1</tt>, <tt>test2</tt>, and <tt>test3</tt>
  run <tt>usertests -q</tt> to make sure you didn't break any other parts
  of the kernel.
