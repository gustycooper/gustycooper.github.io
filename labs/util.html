<h1>Lab: Xv6 and Unix utilities</h1>

<p>This lab will familiarize you with xv6 and its system calls.
   You will learn how to create Unix/Linux utility programs using the
   Unix/Linux API. The Xv6 API is a simplfied Linux API.
For example, the Xv6 API has a single <code>exec</code> function call to execute a new program within a process, whereas, Linux has a family of exec calls (ie., <code>execp</code>, <code>execl</code>, <code>execvp</code>, <code>execlp</code>).

<p>You will create several Unix/Linux utility programs. All of the programs
   have a starting <tt>.c</tt> program that you may have to edit. For example, there
   is a <tt>kittycat.c</tt> program. You must design the code, edit the program,
   and test that it satisfies the requirements. However, I have provided the solution code
   to many of the problems. For those problems, you should study the provided solution code
   so that you understand it. Then your editing will consist of placing the solution code 
   into the appropriate <tt>.c</tt> file.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you begin lab system calls, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
<p>The Linux <tt>grep</tt> command can be helpful on C programming using Linux with a terminal and on some questions. For example, suppose a question asks you about the <tt>struct proc</tt>. You can discover the definition and uses of the <tt>struct proc</tt> by issuing the following Linux <tt>grep</tt> command in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
<pre>
$ <kbd>grep "struct proc" *.h</kbd>
proc.h:struct proc {
... lots of matches
proc.h:struct proc *find_proc(int pid);
proc.h:bool enqueue_proc(struct proc *p);
% <kbd>grep "struct proc" *.c</kbd>
main.c:        struct proc *p = NULL;
... lots of matches
proc.c:    struct proc *p = kernel_proc;
proc.c:    struct proc *p = new_proc(name, priority, ppid);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="required">
<p>In the directory of your xv6-labs, create two files: <b>answers-util.txt</b> and <b>time.txt</b> that I may use 
if I run your code using your zip file submission. The answers-util.txt is a blank file. The time.txt file contains
the number of hours you spent on the lab.
<pre>
$ echo > answers-util.txt
$ echo 8 > time.txt
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Xv6 Utility Programs</h2>
<p>When you <tt>make</tt> Xv6, you are building a system that includes the Xv6 kernel and its utility programs.
The utility programs are placed on a disk image such that when Xv6 bootstraps, the files are available to 
the Xv6 kernel, the Xv6 shell, and the Xv6 utility programs.
The Xv6 system bootstraps into the <tt>qemu</tt> emulator, emulating a RISC-V CPU, a timeer interrupt, a
terminal device, and a disk/SSD device. 
<p>Utility programs are added to the Xv6 system by creating a <tt>.c</tt> program in the <tt>user</tt>
directory and adding the name of the program to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> variable in the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
For example, when adding the <tt>kittycat</tt> utility program, you place the program's file (<tt>kittycat.c</tt>)
in the <tt>user</tt> directory and add <tt>$U/_kittycat\</tt> to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> variable in the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
When you have done this, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program, include it in the resulting system, and you
will be able to run your program from the Xv6 shell.
<p>For this lab, I have provided a <tt>Makefile</tt> where the variable <tt>UPROGS</tt> has all of the lab's utility programs.
In future labs, if you add a new utility program, you will have to remember to update the variable <tt>UPROGS</tt>
<p>You will notice that the hints have words such as 
"Ensure your <tt>kittycat</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt>." 
This has already been done, but you should examine the <tt>Makefile</tt> to see how it has been done. 

<h2>Boot xv6 <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>
You can do these labs on our CPSC server or on your own computer.
If you use your own computer, have a look at the
<a href="../tools.html">lab tools page</a> for setup tips.

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>1.</b> What does it mean to boot (which is short for bootstrap) a computer?
  </div>

<p>Fetch the git repository for the xv6 source for the lab:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/gustycooper/xv6-labs.git</kbd>
Cloning into 'xv6-labs'...
...
$ <kbd>cd xv6-labs</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The repo is setup so that git checkouts the <tt>riscv</tt> branch when
  cloning the repo. You must switch to the <tt>util</tt> branch to conduct this lab.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch riscv
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/riscv'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ <kbd>git checkout util</kbd>
</pre>


<p>The xv6-labs repository differs slightly from the book's
  xv6-riscv; it mostly adds some files. If you are curious look
  at the git log:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git log</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments
are distributed using
the <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control system.
For each of the labs you will checkout (<kbd>git checkout util</kbd>)
a version of xv6 tailored for that lab.
To learn more about Git, take a look at the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, or, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
overview of Git</a> useful.
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want
to checkpoint your progress, you can <i>commit</i> your changes
by running:
</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution for util lab exercise 1'</kbd>
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for util lab exercise 1
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
$
</pre>

<p>
You can keep track of your changes by using the <kbd>git diff</kbd>
command.  Running <kbd>git diff</kbd> will display the changes to your
code since your last commit, and <kbd>git diff
origin/util</kbd> will display the changes relative to the
initial <tt>util</tt> code.  Here, <tt>origin/util</tt> is the
name of the git branch with the initial code you downloaded for the
class.
</p>

These are the files that <tt>mkfs</tt> includes in the
initial file system; most are programs you can run.  You just ran one of them: <tt>ls</tt>.
Several of the files are templates that you must design, edit, and test as part of this lab.
Here are a couple more commands for you to enter.

</pre>
<p>xv6 has no <tt>ps</tt> command, but, if you type <kbd>Ctrl-p</kbd>,
the kernel will print information about each process.
If you try it now, you'll see two lines: one for <tt>init</tt>,
and one for <tt>sh</tt>.

<p>To quit qemu type: <kbd>Ctrl-a x</kbd> (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> at the same time, followed by <kbd>x</kbd>).

<h2>kittycat <script>g("easy - starting code provided")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Implement the UNIX program <tt>kittycat</tt> for xv6; your <tt>kittycat</tt> mimics
  the UNIX <tt>cat</tt> program, but it only concatenates the file <tt>kittycat.txt</tt>
  to standard output. Invoking <tt>kittycat</tt> with an argument results in a error.
  See shell commands below for sample <tt>kittycat</tt> sessions. Your solution should
  be in the file <tt>user/kittycat.c</tt>.
</div>

<p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Before you start coding, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

    <li>The code in <tt>user/kittycat.c</tt> is a duplicate of <tt>user/cat.c</tt>.
    You should study the code in <tt>user/kittycat.c</tt> to understand how the
    UNIX <tt>cat</tt> program works. <tt>cat</tt> places the contents of a file 
    (or multiple files) to standard output. You can redirect <tt>cat's</tt> output
    or pipe it to another UNIX program.

    <li>Look at some of the other programs in <tt>user/</tt>
    (e.g., <tt>user/echo.c</tt>, <tt>user/grep.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/rm.c</tt>) to see how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.

    <li>If the user passes an argument, kittycat should print the error message: 
    <tt>kittycat: No args allowed</tt>.
    <li>Ensure your <tt>kittycat</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt>. 
    The <tt>Makefile</tt> variable <tt>UPROGS</tt> defines all of the utility (or user) programs that
    are included in the Xv6 system that the <tt>Makefile</tt> builds.
    Once you have updated <tt>UPROGS</tt> to include <tt>kittycat</tt>, 
    <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your <tt>kittycat</tt> program and you'll
    be able to run it from the xv6 shell.

  </ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell:
    <pre>
      $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
      ...
      init: starting sh
      $ <kbd>kittycat</kbd>
      This is the text in the file kittycat.

      Soft kitty, warm kitty, 
      little ball of fur! 
      Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, 
      purr purr purr!
      Xv6 kitty, Xv6 kitty,
      grrr, grrr, grrr!

      And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
      Little boy blue and the man in the moon
      "When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when"
      But we'll get together then
      You know we'll have a good time then

      A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair
      Now he don't realize that there's a danger there
      But he don't care no rock 'n' roll chair is gonna boogie on his day
      'Cause when his tail took a low down, syncopate, yeah

      $ <kbd>kittycat gusty</kbd>
      kittycat: No args allowed
    </pre>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>3.</b> What are three songs and artists in the <tt>kittycat</tt> printout? For the "Soft kitty" song, instead of an artist, which in which TV show was it used and by which character?
  </div>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>After you have implemented your <tt>kittycat.c</tt>, you must test it, which in this case is rather easy.
Here is what I would do to test <tt>kittycat.c</tt>
<ul>
<li><tt>$ <kbd>cat kittycat.txt</kbd></tt> - use <tt>cat</tt> to show what is in the <tt>kittycat.txt</tt> file.
<li><tt>$ <kbd>kittycat</kbd></tt> - run <tt>kittycat</tt> and verify that it displays the same information as the previous <tt>cat</tt> command.
<li><tt>$ <kbd>kittycat argument</kbd></tt> - run <tt>kittycat</tt> with an argument and verify that it displays the no args allowed message.
</ul>
<!--  <p>Your solution is correct if your program generates the output shown above.
  Run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to see if you indeed pass the
    <tt>kittycat</tt> tests.

 <p>Note that <kbd>make grade</kbd> runs all tests, including the ones for the assignments
 below. If you want to run the grade tests for one assignment, type:
   <pre>
     $ <kbd>./grade-lab-util kittycat</kbd>
   </pre>
   This will run the grade tests that match "kittycat".  Or, you can type:
   <pre>
     $ <kbd>make GRADEFLAGS=kittycat grade</kbd>
   </pre>
   which does the same.
-->

<h2>sleep <script>g("easy - solution code provided")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Implement the UNIX program <tt>sleep</tt> for xv6; your <tt>sleep</tt> should pause
  for a user-specified number of ticks.  A tick is a notion of time
  defined by the xv6 kernel, namely the time between two interrupts
  from the timer chip.  Your solution should be in the file
  <tt>user/sleep.c</tt>. When running <tt>sleep</tt>, you must pass an integer argument
  that is the number of ticks to sleep. If an argument is not pass, your <tt>sleep</tt>
  must print an error message.
<pre>
$ <kbd>sleep 10</kbd>
$ <kbd>sleep</kbd>
Usage: sleep &lt;ticks>

<p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Before you start coding, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

    <li>Look at some of the other programs in <tt>user/</tt>
    (e.g., <tt>user/echo.c</tt>, <tt>user/grep.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/rm.c</tt>)
    to see
    how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.

    <li>If the user
    forgets to pass an argument, sleep should print an error message.

    <li>The command-line argument is passed as a string; you can convert it to an
      integer using <tt>atoi</tt> (see user/ulib.c).

    <li>Use the system call <tt>sleep</tt>.

    <li>See <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> for
    the xv6 kernel code that implements the <tt>sleep</tt> system
    call (look for <tt>sys_sleep</tt>), <tt>user/user.h</tt>
    for the C definition of <tt>sleep</tt> callable from a
    user program, and <tt>user/usys.S</tt> for the assembler
    code that jumps from user code into the kernel for <tt>sleep</tt>.

    <li><tt>main</tt> should call <tt>exit(0)</tt> when it is done.

    <li>Ensure your <tt>sleep</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    be able to run it from the xv6 shell.

    <li>Look at Kernighan and Ritchie's book <i>The C programming language
        (second edition)</i> (K&R) to learn about C.

<h2>forkexec (fork and exec) <script>g("easy - sample code provided")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
Write a program that calls <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt> to execute the <tt>ls</tt> program as a child process.
<ul>
<li><tt>$ <kbd>forkexec</kbd></tt> - when your program is run without an argument, it calls <tt>ls</tt> to display all files.
<li><tt>$ <kbd>forkexec kittycat</kbd></tt> - when your program is run with an argument, it calls <tt>ls</tt>, passing the argument to <tt>ls</tt>. In this example, <tt>ls</tt> will display the file <tt>kittycat</tt>.
</ul>
</div>

When a process calls <tt>fork()</tt>, it results in a duplicate of the calling process. You now have two processes. 
The return value from fork is used to determine if you are the parent or child process. A return value of 0 indicates you are the child process. A return value of nonzero indicates you are the parent process.

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following code demonstrates a child process calling <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt> to run the <tt>echo</tt> program.
<pre>
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"
int main() {
  int status;
  int pid = fork();
  if(pid == 0){
    char *argv[] = { "echo", "THIS", "IS", "ECHO", 0 };
    exec("echo", argv);

  } else {
    printf("parent waiting\n");
    wait(&status);
    printf("the child exited with status %d\n", status);
  }
  exit(0);
}
</pre>
<li>Notice that the first argument passed to <tt>exec()</tt> is the name of the program to execute.
<li>Notice that the second argument passed to <tt>exec()</tt> is an array of pointers to strings. 
By convention the first element of the array points to the name of the program to execute. The remaining elements are pointers to the arguments passed to the program.
<li>Notice how when calling <tt>exec()</tt>, it never returns if it is successful. The program that is executed overwrites the child process.
<li>Notice how the parent <tt>wait()</tt>'s for the child to terminate.
<li>Your <tt>main</tt> must have parameters as shown below.
<pre>
int main(int argv, char **argv)
</pre>
If the <tt>argv</tt> parameter is 2, then you will pass <tt>argv[1]</tt> as the second element in the second argument passed to <tt>exec()</tt>

<li>The Unix I/O system calls include <tt>open</tt>, <tt>close</tt>, <tt>read</tt>, and <tt>write</tt>.
These are different from the C runtime I/O calls such as <tt>scanf</tt>, <tt>printf</tt>, <tt>fopen</tt>, etc.
The C runtime I/O functions eventually call the Unix I/O system calls because those are the only functions that access the devices to perform I/O. You can see this by reading the file <tt>kernel/printf.c</tt>, which contains C runtime I/O functions.
<li>A file is a sequence of bytes stored on a disk/SSD. In a text file, each byte is a 7-bit ASCII character, which allows it to be a readable file.
<li>If you examined the details of the <tt>num.txt</tt> file shown above in the blue box, you would discover that it is a sequence of 9 bytes that are the following.

0x31 0x30 0xA 0x32 0x30 0xA 0x33 0x30 0xA
</pre>
0x30, 0x31, 0x32, and 0x33 are the hex values for ASCII 0, 1, 2, and 3. And 0xA is the hex value for an ASCII Carriage Return (CR).
The first three bytes of the file are ASCII 1, ASCII 0, and ASCII CR, which is <tt>10\n</tt>.
<li>The <tt>while</tt> loop reads 3 bytes at a time. Each read of 3 bytes consumes a "line", which is a 2-digit number and a CR.
<li>The 3 bytes are read into the character buffer <tt>buf</tt>.
<li>Once in <tt>buf</tt>, the data is printed in various ways.
<ul>
<li><tt>write(1, buf, n);</tt> - this writes 3 bytes to standard out, which is file descriptor 1.
<li>The elements of <tt>buf</tt> are printed as hex values using <tt>%x</tt>.
<li>The elemenst of <tt>buf</tt> are printed as <tt>char</tt> values using <tt>%c</tt>.
<li>The ASCII in <tt>buf</tt> is converted to an integer using the <tt>atoi</tt> function.
<li>The converted integer is printed as an integer using <tt>%d</tt>.
</ul>

<li>Notice how <tt>open</tt> returns an integer file descriptor, which is used by <tt>read</tt> as its first parameter. The other parameters to read are the buffer in which to read data, and the number of bytes to read. The <tt>write</tt> function is similar to <tt>read</tt>.

<h2>primes <script>g("moderate - solution code provided")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
  <p>Write a concurrent version of prime sieve using pipes.  This idea
    is due to Doug McIlroy, inventor of Unix pipes.  The picture

    and the surrounding text explain how to do it.  Your
    solution should be in the file <tt>user/primes.c</tt>.

    <p>Your goal is to use <tt>pipe</tt> and <tt>fork</tt> to set up
    the pipeline. The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35
    into the pipeline.  For each prime number, you will arrange to
    create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe
    and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. Since xv6 has
    limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first
    process can stop at 35.

    <li>Be careful to close file descriptors that a process doesn't
    need, because otherwise your program will run xv6 out of resources
    before the first process reaches 35.

    <li>Once the first process reaches 35, it should wait until the
    entire pipeline terminates, including all children, grandchildren,
    &c. Thus the main primes process should only exit after all the
    output has been printed, and after all the other primes processes
    have exited.

    <li>Hint: <tt>read</tt> returns zero when the write-side of
    a pipe is closed.

    <li>It's simplest to directly write 32-bit (4-byte) <tt>int</tt>s to the

      <li>Command [1] creates the file <tt>b</tt> to have one line (the string <tt>hello</tt>).
      <tt>echo</tt> echos the string <tt>hello</tt> to standard output and the <tt>></tt> character
      redirects standard output to the file b. Command [2] 
      <tt>cat</tt>s <tt>b</tt> to standard output to show it contains <tt>hello</tt>. 
      <li>Commands [3] and [4] create the file <tt>a</tt> to have two lines - line 1 is <tt>b</tt> and
      line 2 is <tt>README</tt>. This awkward use of the Xv6 <tt>cat</tt> creates a two line file.
      I fiddled around until I found a way to create a file with the two lines I wanted.
      Realize that the Xv6 <tt>cat</tt> is a simplified version of the Linux <tt>cat</tt>.
      <li>Command [5] shows that the file <tt>a</tt> has the desired two lines. Each line
      contains a name of a file in the current directory.
      <li>Commands [6] and [7] show the three files <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>README</tt> in the current directory.
      Notice the Xv6 <tt>ls</tt> command shows the file type (1 is file, 2 is directory, etc.), the inode number,
      and the size (in bytes). The <tt>lss</tt> command just shows the file names. We will use the <tt>lss</tt>
      command to pipe filenames to <tt>xargs wc</tt> so there are no spaces in the input stream to <tt>xargs</tt>.
      <li>Command [8] show the two files <tt>b</tt> and <tt>README</tt> in the current directory.
      If you compare the output of the <tt>cat a</tt> of command [5] to the output of <tt>lss b README</tt>
      of command [8], you will see they are identical. They both write the following to standard output. </br>
      <tt>b\nREADME\n</tt> </br>
      <li>Commands [9] and [10] count the lines, words, and characters in the files <tt>b</tt> and <tt>README</tt>.
      <li>Commands [11] and [12] demonstrate how <tt>xargs</tt> works. Both <tt>cat a</tt> and <tt>lss b README</tt>
      generate the same stream of characters to standard output, (i.e., <tt>b\nREADME\n</tt>) which is piped to the 
      standard input of <tt>xargs</tt>.
      <tt>xargs</tt> reads the standard input and applies the command <tt>wc</tt> to each line, where a line is
       marked by the character <tt>'\n'</tt>. This means the commands [11] and [12] are equivalent to the following.

      <li>Commands [1] through [5] use <tt>mkdir</tt> and <tt>echo</tt> to create subdirectories <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>,
      each of which has a file named <tt>b</tt> with the string <tt>hello</tt>. If you are typing this commands in the
      same session as the previous sample commands, you will have to remove the file <tt>a</tt> that we created earlier.
      <li>Command [6] shows the output of <tt>find . b</tt>, which shows a file <tt>b</tt> in the current directory 
      and the subdirectories <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. These three lines of output will be streamed to the
      standard input of <tt>xargs</tt>.
      <li>Commands [7] through [10] show various <tt>grep</tt> commands. <tt>grep</tt> searches a file for a string.
      Notice commands [7] and [8] both search the file b in the current directoy. Command [8] uses a path.
      <li>Command [11] shows the combinations of <tt>xargs</tt>, <tt>find</tt>, and <tt>grep</tt>. <tt>find</tt>
      generates three lines in standard output. Each line is a path of a file name. <tt>xargs</tt> applies the
      command <tt>grep hello</tt> to each of these lines. Command [11] is equivalent to the following.
      <pre>
$ <kbd>grep hello ./b</kbd>
$ <kbd>grep hello ./a/b</kbd>
$ <kbd>grep hello ./c/b</kbd>
      </pre>
      </ul>
    <li><p><tt>xargs</tt> is the parent process and it will use <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt> to invoke the
      command on each line of input.  The <tt>exec</tt>-ed command is the child process.
      <tt>xargs</tt> will use <tt>wait</tt> to wait for the child to complete the command.
    <li>To read individual lines of standard input, read a character at a time
        until a newline (<tt>'\n'</tt>) appears.
    <li><tt>kernel/param.h</tt> declares <tt>MAXARG</tt>, which may be useful if you need
      to declare an argv array.
    <li>Ensure your <tt>xargs</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    <li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kbd>make clean</kbd> and then <kbd>make qemu</kbd>.
  </ul>

<h3>High-level Design</h3>
<p>
<pre>
Process args passed to xargs
Make sure it has at least one argument. 
For example, $ xargs wc
Create a char* array (e.g. xargv) for arguments to the exec call
Put the first arg passed to xargs in xargv[0]
The read loop will put values in xargv[1], xargv[2], ...
READLOOP:
Read 1 character from standard input
If the read returns 0, you exit READLOOP
If the character read is \n 
  if (fork() == 0)
    call exec with xargv
  else
    wait
else if the character read is a space
  move to next element of xargv
else
  concatenate character onto string to put into xargv
GOTO READLOOP
</pre>
<h3>xargs Solution Code</h3>
<pre>
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/param.h"
#include "user/user.h"

void
clear(char *xargv[MAXARG], int start){
  for(int i=start; i<MAXARG; i++){
    xargv[i] = 0;
  }
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  if(argc < 2){
    fprintf(2, "Usage: xarg <cmd>\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  if(argc > MAXARG){
    fprintf(2, "xargs: too many arguments\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  char *xargv[MAXARG] = {0};
  int xargc = 0;
  for(; xargc+1 < argc; xargc++){
    xargv[xargc] = argv[xargc+1];
  }
  char buf[1024], c;
  int p = 0, start = 0;
  while(read(0, &c, 1)){
    switch (c){
    case ' ':
      buf[p] = 0;
      xargv[xargc++] = &buf[start];
      start = p;
      break;
    case '\n':
      buf[p] = 0;
      xargv[xargc++] = &buf[start];
      if(fork() == 0){
        exec(argv[1], xargv);
      } else {
        wait(0);
      }
      xargc = argc - 1;
      clear(xargv, xargc);
      p = 0;
      start = 0;
      break;
    default:
      buf[p++] = c;
      break;
    }
  }
  exit(0);
}

</pre>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>To test your solution for xargs, run the seqence of commands provided in the hints section.
The shell script <tt>xargstest.sh</tt> has been provided. Its contents are the following.
<pre>
mkdir a
echo hello > a/b
mkdir c
echo hello > c/b
echo hello > b
find . b | xargs grep hello
</pre>

<p>The program <tt>sh</tt> is the shell. You can use input redirection to redirect the contents
<tt>xargstest.sh</tt> to the shell as shown next. You output should match this.
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
  ...
  init: starting sh
  $ <kbd>sh < xargstest.sh</kbd>
  $ $ $ $ $ $ hello
  hello
  hello
  $ $
  </pre>
You may have to go back and fix bugs in your find program.  The output has
many <tt>$</tt> because the xv6 shell doesn't realize
it is processing commands from a file instead of from the console, and
prints a <tt>$</tt> for each command in the file.

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>13.</b> The testing has a command <tt>$ <kbd>sh < xargstest.sh</kbd></tt>. What does this command do? What is the <tt>sh</tt> program?
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>14.</b> Perform the following.
<ul>
<li>In a Linux shell enter the command <tt>$ <kbd>echo $SHELL</kbd></tt>. This displays the program that is your currently running shell. On my Mac, it displays <tt>/bin/zsh</tt>, which is the Z shell. On the CPSC server, it displays <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, whish is the Bash (or Bourne Again) shell. 
<li>Enter the command <tt>$ <kbd>ls /bin</kbd></tt> to see all of the Linux commands in the <tt>/bin</tt> directroy. These commands are simply C programs that have been compiled and placed in the <tt>/bin</tt> directory.
<li>Enter the command <tt>$ <kbd>echo $PATH</kbd></tt>. This shows a list of directories that the shell program searches for a matching program when you type in a command. One of the directories in your <tt>PATH</tt> variable is <tt>/bin</tt>. The shell will find various Linux commands in the <tt>/bin</tt> directory. 
<li>Enter the command <tt>$ <kbd>which ls</kbd></tt>. This shows the location of the <tt>ls</tt> program, which is what the shell runs when you enter the <tt>ls</tt> command.
</ul>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>15.</b> What I find amazing is that the basic Unix/Linux API has not changed in 60 years.
    Now that you have written programs with pipes, forks, execs, and I/O redirection, what do you think about the Linux API.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>16.</b> Without looking up functions, list as many Linux API functions that you can think of.
