<h1>Lab: Xv6 and Unix utilities</h1>

<p>This lab will familiarize you with xv6 and its system calls.
   You will learn how to create Unix/Linux utility programs using the
   Unix/Linux API. The Xv6 API is a simplfied Linux API.
For example, the Xv6 API has a single <code>exec</code> function call to execute a new program within a process, whereas, Linux has a family of exec calls (ie., <code>execp</code>, <code>execl</code>, <code>execvp</code>, <code>execlp</code>).

<p>You will create several Unix/Linux utility programs. All of the programs
   have a starting <tt>.c</tt> program that you must edit. For example, there
   is a <tt>kittycat.c</tt> program. You must design the code, edit the program,
   and test that it satisfies the requirements. 

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you begin lab system calls, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
Additionally, in the directory of your xv6-labs, create the file: <b>answers-util.txt</b>. You do not need to put answers in 
this file, but the grading script checks to see if this file exists. If it exists, I assume you have answered the questions
in your notebook.
</div>

<h2>Boot xv6 <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>
You can do these labs on our CPSC server or on your own computer.
If you use your own computer, have a look at the
<a href="../tools.html">lab tools page</a> for setup tips.

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>1.</b> What does it mean to boot (which is short for bootstrap) a computer?
  </div>

<p>Fetch the git repository for the xv6 source for the lab:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/gustycooper/xv6-labs.git</kbd>
Cloning into 'xv6-labs'...
...
$ <kbd>cd xv6-labs</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The repo is setup so that git checkouts the <tt>riscv</tt> branch when
  cloning the repo. You must switch to the <tt>util</tt> branch to conduct this lab.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git status</kbd>
On branch riscv
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/riscv'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ <kbd>git checkout util</kbd>
</pre>


<p>The xv6-labs repository differs slightly from the book's
  xv6-riscv; it mostly adds some files. If you are curious look
  at the git log:
<pre>
$ <kbd>git log</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments
are distributed using
the <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control system.
For each of the labs you will checkout (<kbd>git checkout util</kbd>)
a version of xv6 tailored for that lab.
To learn more about Git, take a look at the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, or, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
overview of Git</a> useful.
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want
to checkpoint your progress, you can <i>commit</i> your changes
by running:
</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution for util lab exercise 1'</kbd>
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for util lab exercise 1
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
$
</pre>

<p>
You can keep track of your changes by using the <kbd>git diff</kbd>
command.  Running <kbd>git diff</kbd> will display the changes to your
code since your last commit, and <kbd>git diff
origin/util</kbd> will display the changes relative to the
initial <tt>util</tt> code.  Here, <tt>origin/util</tt> is the
name of the git branch with the initial code you downloaded for the
class.
</p>

<p>Build and run xv6:

These are the files that <tt>mkfs</tt> includes in the
initial file system; most are programs you can run.  You just ran one of them: <tt>ls</tt>.
Several of the files are templates that you must design, edit, and test as part of this lab.
Here are a couple more commands for you to enter.
<pre>
$ <kbd>echo kittycat</kbd>
kittycat
$ <kbd>cat kittycat.txt</kbd>
This is the text in the file kittycat.

Soft kitty, warm kitty, 
little ball of fur! 
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, 
purr purr purr!
Xv6 kitty, Xv6 kitty,
grrr, grrr, grrr!

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when"
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair
Now he don't realize that there's a danger there
But he don't care no rock 'n' roll chair is gonna boogie on his day
'Cause when his tail took a low down, syncopate, yeah
</pre>
<p>xv6 has no <tt>ps</tt> command, but, if you type <kbd>Ctrl-p</kbd>,
the kernel will print information about each process.
If you try it now, you'll see two lines: one for <tt>init</tt>,
and one for <tt>sh</tt>.

<p>To quit qemu type: <kbd>Ctrl-a x</kbd> (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> at the same time, followed by <kbd>x</kbd>).

<h2>Grading and hand-in procedure</h2>

<p>
You can run <kbd>make grade</kbd>
to test your solutions with the grading program. I will use the same
grading program to assign your lab submission a
grade. Separately, we will also have check-off meetings for labs (see
<a href="../general.html#grading">Grading policy</a>).
</p>

<p>The lab code comes with GNU Make rules to make submission easier. After
committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>HERE::make handin</kbd> to submit
  your lab.  For detailed instructions on how to submit see <a href="#submit">below</a>.

<h2>kittycat <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Implement the UNIX program <tt>kittycat</tt> for xv6; your <tt>kittycat</tt> mimics
  the UNIX <tt>cat</tt> program, but it only concatenates the file <tt>kittycat.txt</tt>
  to standard output. Invoking <tt>kittycat</tt> with an argument results in a error.
  See shell commands below for sample <tt>kittycat</tt> sessions. Your solution should
  be in the file <tt>user/kittycat.c</tt>.
</div>

<p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Before you start coding, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

    <li>The code in <tt>user/kittycat.c</tt> is a duplicate of <tt>user/cat.c</tt>.
    You should study the code in <tt>user/kittycat.c</tt> to understand how the
    UNIX <tt>cat</tt> program works. <tt>cat</tt> places the contents of a file 
    (or multiple files) to standard output. You can redirect <tt>cat's</tt> output
    or pipe it to another UNIX program.

    <li>Look at some of the other programs in <tt>user/</tt>
    (e.g., <tt>user/echo.c</tt>, <tt>user/grep.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/rm.c</tt>) to see how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.

    <li>If the user passes an argument, kittycat should print the error message: 
    <tt>kittycat: No args allowed</tt>.
    <li>Ensure your <tt>kittycat</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    be able to run it from the xv6 shell.


  </ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell:
    <pre>
      $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
      ...
      init: starting sh
      $ <kbd>kittycat</kbd>
      This is the text in the file kittycat.

      Soft kitty, warm kitty, 
      little ball of fur! 
      Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, 
      purr purr purr!
      Xv6 kitty, Xv6 kitty,
      grrr, grrr, grrr!

      And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
      Little boy blue and the man in the moon
      "When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when"
      But we'll get together then
      You know we'll have a good time then

      A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair
      Now he don't realize that there's a danger there
      But he don't care no rock 'n' roll chair is gonna boogie on his day

      $ <kbd>kittycat gusty</kbd>
      kittycat: No args allowed
    </pre>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>3.</b> What are three songs and artists in the <tt>kittycat</tt> printout? For the "Soft kitty" song, instead of an artist, which in which TV show was it used and by which character?
  </div>

<h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>Your solution is correct if your program generates the output shown above.
  Run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to see if you indeed pass the
    <tt>kittycat</tt> tests.

 <p>Note that <kbd>make grade</kbd> runs all tests, including the ones for the assignments
 below. If you want to run the grade tests for one assignment, type:
   <pre>
     $ <kbd>./grade-lab-util kittycat</kbd>
   </pre>
   This will run the grade tests that match "kittycat".  Or, you can type:
   <pre>
     $ <kbd>make GRADEFLAGS=kittycat grade</kbd>
   </pre>
   which does the same.


<h2>sleep <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Implement the UNIX program <tt>sleep</tt> for xv6; your <tt>sleep</tt> should pause
  for a user-specified number of ticks.  A tick is a notion of time
  defined by the xv6 kernel, namely the time between two interrupts
  from the timer chip.  Your solution should be in the file
  <tt>user/sleep.c</tt>.
</div>

<p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Before you start coding, read Chapter 1 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

    <li>Look at some of the other programs in <tt>user/</tt>
    (e.g., <tt>user/echo.c</tt>, <tt>user/grep.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/rm.c</tt>)
    to see
    how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.

    <li>If the user
    forgets to pass an argument, sleep should print an error message.

    <li>The command-line argument is passed as a string; you can convert it to an
      integer using <tt>atoi</tt> (see user/ulib.c).

    <li>Use the system call <tt>sleep</tt>.

    <li>See <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> for
    the xv6 kernel code that implements the <tt>sleep</tt> system
    call (look for <tt>sys_sleep</tt>), <tt>user/user.h</tt>
    for the C definition of <tt>sleep</tt> callable from a
    user program, and <tt>user/usys.S</tt> for the assembler
    code that jumps from user code into the kernel for <tt>sleep</tt>.

    <li><tt>main</tt> should call <tt>exit(0)</tt> when it is done.

    <li>Ensure your <tt>sleep</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    be able to run it from the xv6 shell.

    <li>Look at Kernighan and Ritchie's book <i>The C programming language
        (second edition)</i> (K&R) to learn about C.

  </ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell:
    <pre>
      $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
      ...
      init: starting sh
      $ <kbd>sleep 10</kbd>
      (nothing happens for a little while)
      $
    </pre>
  <p>Your solution is correct if your program pauses when
  run as shown above.
  Run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to see if you indeed pass the
    sleep tests.

 <p>Note that <kbd>make grade</kbd> runs all tests, including the ones for the assignments
 below. If you want to run the grade tests for one assignment, type:
   <pre>
     $ <kbd>./grade-lab-util sleep</kbd>
   </pre>
   This will run the grade tests that match "sleep".  Or, you can type:
   <pre>
     $ <kbd>make GRADEFLAGS=sleep grade</kbd>
   </pre>
   which does the same.

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>4.</b> Use the process state diagram to explain how you think the OS implements a sleeping process.
  </div>


<h2>pingpong <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Write a program that uses UNIX system calls to ''ping-pong'' a
  byte between two processes over a pair of pipes, one for each
  direction.
  The parent should send a byte to the child;
  the child should print "&lt;pid&gt;: received ping",
  where &lt;pid&gt; is its process ID,
  write the byte on the pipe to the parent,
  and exit;
  the parent should read the byte from the child,
  print "&lt;pid&gt;: received pong",
  and exit.
  Your
  solution should be in the file <tt>user/pingpong.c</tt>.
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <tt>pipe</tt> to create a pipe.
    <li>Use <tt>fork</tt> to create a child.
    <li>Use <tt>read</tt> to read from a pipe, and <tt>write</tt> to write to a pipe.
    <li>Use <tt>getpid</tt> to find the process ID of the calling process.
    <li>Ensure your <tt>pingpong</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    <li>User programs on xv6 have a limited set of library
    functions available to them. You can see the list in
    <tt>user/user.h</tt>; the source (other than for system calls)
    is in <tt>user/ulib.c</tt>, <tt>user/printf.c</tt>,
    and <tt>user/umalloc.c</tt>.
  </ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell and it should produce the
  following output:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>pingpong</kbd>
    4: received ping
    3: received pong
    $
  </pre>
    <p>Your solution is correct if your program exchanges a byte
    between two processes and produces output as shown above.


  <div class="question">
    <p><b>5.</b> Explain in your own words what a Xv6/Linux pipe is - not a pipe used for smoking.
  </div>

<h2>primes <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
  <p>Write a concurrent version of prime sieve using pipes.  This idea
    is due to Doug McIlroy, inventor of Unix pipes.  The picture
    halfway down <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/">this page</a>
    and the surrounding text explain how to do it.  Your
    solution should be in the file <tt>user/primes.c</tt>.
</div>

    <p>Your goal is to use <tt>pipe</tt> and <tt>fork</tt> to set up
    the pipeline. The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35
    into the pipeline.  For each prime number, you will arrange to
    create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe
    and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. Since xv6 has
    limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first
    process can stop at 35.

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Be careful to close file descriptors that a process doesn't
    need, because otherwise your program will run xv6 out of resources
    before the first process reaches 35.

    <li>Once the first process reaches 35, it should wait until the
    entire pipeline terminates, including all children, grandchildren,
    &c. Thus the main primes process should only exit after all the
    output has been printed, and after all the other primes processes
    have exited.

    <li>Hint: <tt>read</tt> returns zero when the write-side of
    a pipe is closed.

    <li>It's simplest to directly write 32-bit (4-byte) <tt>int</tt>s to the
        pipes, rather than using formatted ASCII I/O.

    <li>You should create the processes in the pipeline only as they are
      needed.

    <li>Ensure your <tt>primes</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll

  </ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Your solution is correct if it implements a pipe-based
sieve and produces the following output:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>primes</kbd>
    prime 2
    prime 3
    prime 5
    prime 7
    prime 11
    prime 13
    prime 17
    prime 19
    prime 23
    prime 29
    prime 31
    $
  </pre>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>6.</b> Do you think there is a largest prime number such that it is the last prime number? What are the number of digits in the largest prime number discovers so far? When was it discovered?
  </div>

<h2>find <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Write a simple version of the UNIX find program: find all the files
  in a directory tree with a specific name.  Your solution
  should be in the file <tt>user/find.c</tt>.
  The <tt>find</tt> program has two arguments - the path in which to begin searching
  and the filename for which to search. For example, <br>
  <tt>$ </tt><kbd>find . b</kbd><br>
  searches all subdirectories of the current directory for the filenamed <tt>b</tt>.
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at <tt>user/ls.c</tt> to see how to read directories.
    <li>Use recursion to allow find to descend into sub-directories.
    <li>Don't recurse into "." and "..".
    <li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kbd>make clean</kbd> and then <kbd>make qemu</kbd>.
    <li>You'll need to use C strings. Have a look at K&R (the C book),
      for example Section 5.5.
    <li> Note that == does not compare strings like in Python. Use <tt>strcmp()</tt> instead.
    <li>Ensure your <tt>find</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Your solution is correct if produces the following output (when the
  file system contains the files <tt>b</tt>, <tt>a/b</tt> and <tt>a/aa/b</tt>):
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh

    ./a/b
    ./a/aa/b
    $
  </pre>

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>7.</b> What does the Linux command <tt>$ </tt><kbd> echo > b</kbd> do?
  </div>

<h2>xargs <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Write a simple version of the UNIX xargs program: its arguments
  describe a command to run, it reads lines from
  the standard input, and it runs the command for each line, appending the line to
  the command's arguments.   Your solution
  should be in the file <tt>user/xargs.c</tt>.
</div>

  The following example illustrates xarg's
  behavior:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>echo hello too | xargs echo bye</kbd>
    bye hello too
    $
  </pre>
  Note that the command here is "echo bye" and the additional
  arguments are "hello too", making the command "echo bye hello too",
  which outputs "bye hello too".

  <p> Please note that xargs on UNIX makes an optimization where it will feed more than argument to the command at a time. We don't expect you to make this optimization. To make xargs on UNIX behave the way we want it to for this lab, please run it with the -n option set to 1. For instance</p>
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>(echo 1 ; echo 2) | xargs -n 1 echo</kbd>
    1
    2
    $
  </pre>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The first argument to <tt>xargs</tt> is the program to execute. The command
     <kbd>xargs grep hello</kbd> executes the program <tt>grep</tt>, which is the first
     argument passed to <tt>xargs</tt>
    <li><tt>xargs</tt> is typically used on the right side of a pipe. This means the left side
      of the pipe generates output that is seen as <tt>xargs</tt> standard input. <tt>xargs</tt>
      sees this standard input as a sequence of lines, each terminated with a <tt>\n</tt>.

    <li><tt>xargs</tt> executes the program on each line seen from standard input. 
    <li>Consider the example sequence of commands that works with three files <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>README</tt>.
      <tt>README</tt> exists and we use <tt>echo</tt> to create <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.
      I have numbered the commands in order to reference them.
      You should enter the commands in the Xv6 shell as you study to better understand <tt>xargs</tt>.

      <ul>
      <li>Command [1] creates the file <tt>b</tt> to have one line (the string <tt>hello</tt>).
      <tt>echo</tt> echos the string <tt>hello</tt> to standard output and the <tt>></tt> character
      redirects standard output to the file b. Command [2] 
      <tt>cat</tt>s <tt>b</tt> to standard output to show it contains <tt>hello</tt>. 
      <li>Commands [3] and [4] create the file <tt>a</tt> to have two lines - line 1 is <tt>b</tt> and
      line 2 is <tt>README</tt>. This awkward use of the Xv6 <tt>cat</tt> creates a two line file.
      I fiddled around until I found a way to create a file with the two lines I wanted.
      Realize that the Xv6 <tt>cat</tt> is a simplified version of the Linux <tt>cat</tt>.
      <li>Command [5] shows that the file <tt>a</tt> has the desired two lines. Each line
      contains a name of a file in the current directory.
      <li>Commands [6] and [7] show the three files <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>README</tt> in the current directory.
      Notice the Xv6 <tt>ls</tt> command shows the file type (1 is file, 2 is directory, etc.), the inode number,
      and the size (in bytes). The <tt>lss</tt> command just shows the file names. We will use the <tt>lss</tt>
      command to pipe filenames to <tt>xargs wc</tt> so there are no spaces in the input stream to <tt>xargs</tt>.
      <li>Command [8] show the two files <tt>b</tt> and <tt>README</tt> in the current directory.
      If you compare the output of the <tt>cat a</tt> of command [5] to the output of <tt>lss b README</tt>
      of command [8], you will see they are identical. They both write the following to standard output. </br>
      <tt>b\nREADME\n</tt> </br>
      <li>Commands [9] and [10] count the lines, words, and characters in the files <tt>b</tt> and <tt>README</tt>.
      <li>Commands [11] and [12] demonstrate how <tt>xargs</tt> works. Both <tt>cat a</tt> and <tt>lss b README</tt>
      generate the same stream of characters to standard output, (i.e., <tt>b\nREADME\n</tt>) which is piped to the 
      standard input of <tt>xargs</tt>.
      <tt>xargs</tt> reads the standard input and applies the command <tt>wc</tt> to each line, where a line is
       marked by the character <tt>'\n'</tt>. This means the commands [11] and [12] are equivalent to the following.
      <pre>
$ <kbd>wc b</kbd>
$ <kbd>wc README</kbd>
      </pre>
      </ul>
    <li><tt>xargs</tt>, <tt>find</tt>, and <tt>grep</tt> combine well. Consider the example sequence of commands.
      <pre>
$ <kbd>mkdir a</kbd>                      <b>[1]</b> 
$ <kbd>echo hello > a/b</kbd>             <b>[2]</b> 
$ <kbd>mkdir c</kbd>                      <b>[3]</b> 
$ <kbd>echo hello > c/b</kbd>             <b>[4]</b> 
$ <kbd>echo hello > b</kbd>               <b>[5]</b> 
$ <kbd>find . b</kbd>                     <b>[6]</b> 
./b
./a/b
./c/b
$ <kbd>grep hello b</kbd>                 <b>[7]</b> 
hello
$ <kbd>grep hello ./b</kbd>               <b>[8]</b> 
hello
$ <kbd>grep hello a/b</kbd>               <b>[9]</b> 
hello
$ <kbd>grep hello ./a/b</kbd>             <b>[10]</b> 
hello
$ <kbd>find . b | xargs grep hello</kbd>  <b>[11]</b> 
hello
hello
hello
      </pre>
      <ul>
      <li>Commands [1] through [5] use <tt>mkdir</tt> and <tt>echo</tt> to create subdirectories <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>,
      each of which has a file named <tt>b</tt> with the string <tt>hello</tt>. If you are typing this commands in the
      same session as the previous sample commands, you will have to remove the file <tt>a</tt> that we created earlier.
      <li>Command [6] shows the output of <tt>find . b</tt>, which shows a file <tt>b</tt> in the current directory 
      and the subdirectories <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. These three lines of output will be streamed to the
      standard input of <tt>xargs</tt>.
      <li>Commands [7] through [10] show various <tt>grep</tt> commands. <tt>grep</tt> searches a file for a string.
      Notice commands [7] and [8] both search the file b in the current directoy. Command [8] uses a path.
      <li>Command [11] shows the combinations of <tt>xargs</tt>, <tt>find</tt>, and <tt>grep</tt>. <tt>find</tt>
      generates three lines in standard output. Each line is a path of a file name. <tt>xargs</tt> applies the
      command <tt>grep hello</tt> to each of these lines. Command [11] is equivalent to the following.
      <pre>
$ <kbd>grep hello ./b</kbd>
$ <kbd>grep hello ./a/b</kbd>
$ <kbd>grep hello ./c/b</kbd>
      </pre>
      </ul>
    <li><p><tt>xargs</tt> is the parent process and it will use <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt> to invoke the
      command on each line of input.  The <tt>exec</tt>-ed command is the child process.
      <tt>xargs</tt> will use <tt>wait</tt> to wait for the child to complete the command.
    <li>To read individual lines of standard input, read a character at a time
        until a newline (<tt>'\n'</tt>) appears.
    <li><tt>kernel/param.h</tt> declares <tt>MAXARG</tt>, which may be useful if you need
      to declare an argv array.
    <li>Ensure your <tt>xargs</tt> program has been added <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile; once you've
    done that, <tt>make qemu</tt> will compile your program and you'll
    <li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kbd>make clean</kbd> and then <kbd>make qemu</kbd>.
  </ul>

<h3>High-level Design</h3>
<p>
<pre>
Process args passed to xargs
Make sure it has at least one argument. 
For example, $ xargs wc
Create a char* array (e.g. xargv) for arguments to the exec call
Put the first arg passed to xargs in xargv[0]
The read loop will put values in xargv[1], xargv[2], ...
READLOOP:
Read 1 character from standard input
If the read returns 0, you exit READLOOP
If the character read is \n 
  if (fork() == 0)
    call exec with xargv
  else
    wait
else if the character read is a space
  move to next element of xargv
else
  concatenate character onto string to put into xargv
GOTO READLOOP
</pre>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>To test your solution for xargs, run the seqence of commands provided in the hints section.
The shell script <tt>xargstest.sh</tt> has been provided. Its contents are the following.
<pre>
mkdir a
echo hello > a/b
mkdir c
echo hello > c/b
echo hello > b
find . b | xargs grep hello
</pre>

<p>The program <tt>sh</tt> is the shell. You can use input redirection to redirect the contents
<tt>xargstest.sh</tt> to the shell as shown next. You output should match this.
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
  ...
  init: starting sh
  $ <kbd>sh < xargstest.sh</kbd>
  $ $ $ $ $ $ hello
  hello
  hello
  $ $
  </pre>
You may have to go back and fix bugs in your find program.  The output has
many <tt>$</tt> because the xv6 shell doesn't realize
it is processing commands from a file instead of from the console, and
prints a <tt>$</tt> for each command in the file.

    <p><b>8.</b> What I find amazing is that the basic Unix/Linux API has not changed in 60 years.
    Now that you have written programs with pipes, forks, execs, and I/O redirection, what do you think about the Linux API.

<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> Make sure you pass all of the <tt>make
grade</tt> tests. 

Read <a href="../labsubmissions.html" >Lab Submissions</a> for instructions on how
to submit your lab.

<!--
<div class="required">
<p>I have to study how I want to submit labs. One option is to <kbd>make tarball</kbd> 
  and place the tarball on Canvas. Another option is to simple look at teams' GitHub accounts.
</div>


You will turn in your assignments using
the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2022/handin.py/">submission
website</a>.  You need to request once an API key from the submission
website before you can turn in any assignments or labs.
</p>

<p>After committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>make
handin</kbd> to submit your lab.

<kbd>make handin</kbd> will store your API key in <i>myapi.key</i>. If you need
to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If you run <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2022/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
</p>

<p>
<div class="warning">
<ul>
  <li>Please run <tt>make grade</tt> to ensure that your code passes all of the tests</li>
  <li>Commit any modified source code before running `make handin`</li>

<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li><p>Write an uptime program that prints the uptime in terms of
      ticks using the <tt>uptime</tt> system call. <script>g("easy")</script>
      </li>

  <li><p>Support regular expressions in name matching
  for <tt>find</tt>.  <tt>grep.c</tt> has some primitive support for
  regular expressions.  <script>g("easy")</script>
      </li>

  <li><p>The xv6 shell (<tt>user/sh.c</tt>) is just another user
      program and you can improve it. It is a minimal shell and lacks
      many features found in real shell. For example, modify the shell
      to not print a <tt>$</tt> when processing shell commands from a
      file <script>g("moderate")</script>, modify the shell to
      support wait <script>g("easy")</script>, modify the shell to
      support lists of commands, separated by ";"
      <script>g("moderate")</script>, modify the shell to support
      sub-shells by implementing "(" and ")"
      <script>g("moderate")</script>, modify the shell to support
      tab completion <script>g("easy")</script>, modify the shell to
      keep a history of passed shell commands
      <script>g("moderate")</script>, or anything else you would
      like your shell to do. (If you are very ambitious, you may have
      to modify the kernel to support the kernel features you need;
      xv6 doesn't support much.)
