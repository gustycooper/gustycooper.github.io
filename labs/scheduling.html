<h1>Lab: Scheduling</h1>

<p>In this lab you will implement a priority scheduler for xv6. 
<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you begin lab scheduling, 
<ul>
<li>Read "Chapter 7: Scheduling" in the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.
<li>Read Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in 
  <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OS Three Easy Pieces</a>
</ul>
</div>
   
<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
Additionally, in the directory of your xv6-labs, create the file: <b>answers-scheduling.txt</b>. You do not need to put answers in 
this file, but the grading script checks to see if this file exists. If it exists, I assume you have answered the questions
in your notebook.
</div>

<p>Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the <tt>scheduling</tt> branch:

<pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout scheduling</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
</pre>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Xv6's <tt>proc.h</tt> and <tt>proc.c</tt></h3>
<p>The files <tt>proc.h</tt> and <tt>proc.c</tt> contain the data structures and algorithms
used to implement Xv6's process model. The data structure <tt>struct proc</tt> defines process information
that Xv6 uses. When performing Lab syscall, you added members to <tt>struct proc</tt>.
For Lab Scheduling, I have added members to <tt>struct proc</tt> and code to <tt>proc.c</tt>.
<ul>
<li><tt>struct proc</tt> has a member <tt>int priority</tt> that you will use.
<li><tt>proc.h</tt> has a <tt>struct prochist</tt> for maintaining a cirucular buffer of
procs that are scheduled.
<li><tt>proc.c</tt> has a function <tt>proc_hist()</tt> that when called adds information to
the <tt>prochist[]</tt> circular buffer.
<li><tt>param.h</tt> has two macros used for selecting a scheduling policy.
<pre>
#define SCHED_RR      0  // Round-Robin Scheduler
#define SCHED_PRIOR   1  // Priority-Based Scheduler
</pre>
<li><tt>proc.c</tt> has a static variable <tt>int schedular_policy</tt> that can be set to
either <tt>SCHED_RR</tt> for a round-robin scheduler or <tt>SCHED_PRIOR</tt> for a 
priority scheduler.
<li><tt>proc.c</tt> has an updated <tt>scheduler()</tt> function that includes a conditional
statement to select a scheduling policy based on the value of the variable <tt>schedular_policy</tt>.
As provided the conditional executes the original Xv6 round-robin scheduler for both conditions.
You will update the <tt>SCHED_PRIOR</tt> condition to be a priority scheduler.
<li>The updated <tt>scheduler()</tt> in <tt>proc.c</tt> calls <tt>proc_hist()</tt> to add information
to <tt>prochist[]</tt>.
</ul>
<h3>Xv6 Process States</h3>
<p>The file <tt>proc.h</tt> defines the enumerated type <tt>procstate</tt> as follows.

<pre>
enum procstate { UNUSED, USED, SLEEPING, RUNNABLE, RUNNING, ZOMBIE };
</pre>

<p>Processes have a state diagram that is summarized as follows. 
<p>

<img src="procstates_1.png" alt="Process States" >

<p>The scheduling algorithm
searches a list of <i>Runnable</i> processes, selects the next process to run, and <i>runs</i> it.
Running a process involves a context switch, which is described in the next section. 
The scheduling algorithm performs both the <i>Scheduled</i> arrow and the <i>Descheduled</i> arrows.
The arrow labeled <i>Scheduled</i> moves a process from <i>Runnable</i> to <i>Running</i>, while at 
the same time the arrow labeled <i>Descheduled</i> moves the <i>Running</i> process back to 
the list of <i>Runnable</i> processes.

<p>You will notice that <tt>procstate</tt> defines three additional states <tt>UNUSED</tt>, <tt>USED</tt>,
and <tt>ZOMBIE</tt>. An <tt>UNUSED</tt> proc is available to be allocated. A proc is temporarily in
the <tt>USED</tt> state until it is finally aloocated when it becomes <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>. 

<div class="question">
<p><b>1.</b> Provide two examples of something a process can do that causes it to transition from
<tt>RUNNING</tt> to <tt>SLEEPING</tt>.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>2.</b> Provide two example events that cause a process to transition from
<tt>SLEEPING</tt> to <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>3.</b> Look up what it means a Linux process to be in a <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state. Write the answer 
and create a program that results in a process in a <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state. Use the Xv6 <tt>ctrl-p</tt>
command to demonstrate your program results in a process that is in the <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state.
Since the program is such a few line, hand write the code in your notebook.
</div>

<p>Another terminology for process states is <i>Running</i>, <i>Ready</i>, and <i>Blocked</i>.
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OS Three Easy Pieces</a> uses this terminology.
The following is a process state transition diagram using these terms.
<p>

<img src="procstates_2.png" alt="Process States" >

<h3>Xv6 Scheduler and Context Switches</h3>

<p>Xv6 supports a maximum 64 concurrent processes, and they are defined in the array <tt>struct proc proc[NPROC];</tt>
where <tt>param.h</tt> contains <tt>#define NPROC 64</tt>, and
<tt>proc.h</tt> contains the definition of a <tt>struct proc</tt>. <tt>struc proc</tt> has many members, one of 
which is <tt>enum procstate state;</tt>. The function <tt>procinit()</tt> in <tt>proc.c</tt> initializes all
of the <tt>struct proc</tt> elements in the array <tt>proc[]</tt> to <tt>UNUSED</tt>. 
An allocated process (<tt>allocproc()</tt> is briefly in the <tt>USED</tt> state   
until it is made <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>.

<div class="question">
<p><b>4.</b> Why do you think <tt>allocproc()</tt> used the intermediate state <tt>USED</tt>? You will have to 
examine the code to answer this.
</div>

<p>The Xv6 <tt>scheduler()</tt> iterates through the <tt>struct proc proc[]</tt> array searching
for a <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> process. Once the scheduling algorithm selects a <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> process, Xv6
performs a context switch from the <tt>scheduler</tt> to the selected process. Context switches are
a key component in operating systems. A timer interrupt causes the scheduling algorithm to run.
Consider that the OS is currenting executing process <i>Coletta</i> when a timer interrupt occurs.
First a context switch from <i>Coletta</i> to the <tt>scheduler</tt> must occur. Then, after
the <tt>scheduler</tt> has selected <i>Opal</i> to run, a context switch from the <tt>scheduler</tt>
to <i>Opal</i> must occur. Once Xv6 has booted, the <tt>scheduler</tt> enters an endless loop
searching for <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> processes and performing context switches to them. 
The <tt>scheduler</tt> runs in kernel mode.
Xv6 creates the <tt>initproc</tt>, and the <tt>scheduler</tt> runs it (i.e., performs a context swithc). 
The <tt>initproc</tt> creates the <tt>sh</tt> (shell) process, and the <tt>scheduler</tt> runs it.
The shell allows you to enter commands. The shell <tt>fork</tt>s these commands as processes. 
Each command is a program. The shell performs a two step seqence for each command.
<ul>
<li>Call <tt>fork()</tt> to create a duplicate shell process.
<li>Call <tt>exec()</tt> to replace the duplicate shell with the command's program.
</ul>
  
<p> The following diagrams displays a context switch from a process <i>Coletta</i> to a process <i>Opal</i>.
<p>
<img src="contextswitch.png" alt="Context Switch" >

<p>
There is a lot to digest in the above simple-looking context switch diagram. The process <i>Coletta</i> is running
in user mode, when a timer interrupt occurs, which is the OS interrupt used for a context switch.
On the RISCV architecture, the timer interrupt is immediately processed in machine mode by <tt>timervec()</tt> 
(in <tt>kernelvec.S</tt>), which
issues a software interrupt that is processed by <tt>uservec()</tt> (in <tt>trampoline.S</tt>). 
The RISCV CPU is now in supervisor 
mode, but the CPU is still using the page table of <i>Coletta</i> - not the OS page table. 
The code for <tt>uservec()</tt> is on the <i>trampoline</i> page, which is mapped 
in each user proc's page table. 
<i>Coletta</i>'s <i>trampoline</i> page is marked to allow execution in supervisor mode.
To refresh your memory on memory layout, you can examine <tt>memlayout.h</tt> and Figure 3.3 
of <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">our xv6 text book</a>, which was part of our page table studies.
Having the <i>trampoline</i> page mapped to <i>Coletta</i>'s page table allows <tt>uservec()</tt> 
to begin executing in supervisor mode prior to changin to the 
OS page table, which also maps the <i>trampoline</i> page to the same address. 
Thus <tt>uservec()</tt> can switch to the OS page table and continue executing the <i>trampoline</i> code. 
Before switching to the OS page table, <tt>uservec</tt>
saves all registers in <i>Coletta</i>'s TRAPFRAME. Each process has a unique physical page allocated as its
TRAPFRAME. Each process's TRAPFRAME mapped to the same virtual address, which allows <tt>uservec()</tt> to
save the registers. The process's <tt>struc proc</tt> member <tt>p->trapframe</tt> 
points to the trapframe with its physical address, which allows the kernel to access the process's
TRAPFRAME using the kernel page table.

<div class="question">
<p><b>5.</b> Explain the processing of a timer interrupt in your own words.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>6.</b> <tt>uservec()</tt> in <tt>trampoline.S</tt> begins execution using a process page table
and transitions to the OS page table.
<ul>
<li>How is is possible to use a process page table when the interrupt is in kernel mode?
<li>What register is changed to transition from the process page table to the kernel page table?
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>7.</b> Draw Figure 3-4 from  <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">our xv6 text book</a> in your notebook.
<ul>
<li>Is this a mapping of a process's virtual address space or physical address space?
<li>Where are the TRAMPOLINE and TRAPEFRAME pages located?
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Xv6's Round Robin Scheduler</h3>
<p>The Xv6 function <tt>scheduler()</tt> in the file <tt>proc.c</tt> implements a round robin scheduler.

<div class="question">
<p><b>8.</b> Explain how the algorithm in <tt>scheduler()</tt> implements a round robin scheduler.
NOTE: The answer is a little trickier than you may think.
</div>

<h3>Xv6's Priority Scheduler</h3>
<p>You will implement a priority scheduler.

<div class="question">
<p><b>9.</b> Create a design for your priority scheduler. You must complete this before you begin
implementing the code for your priority scheduler.
</div>

<h3>Scheduler Tester - <tt>testschd.c</tt></h3>
I have provided <tt>testschd.c</tt> to test scheduler algorithms. The program creates three processes
with varying priorities. The processes have names <i>Coletta</i>, <i>Opal</i>, and <i>Florence</i>.
Their default priorites are 
<ul>
<li><i>Coletta</i> - 50
<li><i>Opal</i> - 51
<li><i>Florence</i> - 52
</ul>
The priorities can be changed by invoking 
<pre>
<kbd> $ testschd 20 3 31</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The <tt>testschd.c</tt> program calls the system call function <tt>spoon()</tt>, which is exactly like <tt>fork()</tt>, 
but <tt>spoon()</tt> allows you to name the function. The function name is copied into the 
<tt>struct proc</tt> member <tt>name</tt>. Without <tt>spoon()</tt> all of the processes of <tt>testsched</tt> 
would have the name of their parent - e.g., they would be named <tt>testschd</tt>.

<p>You must implement <tt>spoon()</tt> before <tt>testschd.c</tt> will run. Or you can change the calls to
<tt>spoon</tt> to be calls to <tt>fork</tt>.

<p><a name="controlp"></>
<h3>Scheduler Tester - <tt>ctrl-p</tt> </h3>
<p>Xv6 provides a <tt>ctrl-p</tt> that shows processes and their states. <tt>ctrl-p</tt> is similar to 
Linux <tt>ps</tt> command.
<p>You can enter <tt>ctrl-p</tt> at any time and it displays
<pre>
proc_id priority state name
</pre>

<p>The following shows entering <tt>ctrl-p</tt> while <tt>testschd</tt> is running. The display shows the
processes pid, priority, state, and name. Notice the various states of <tt>sleep</tt>, <tt>runble</tt>,
and <tt>run</tt>. This was done on a Xv6 build with <tt>CPUS=1</tt> so there is only one process in
the state <tt>run</tt>. Also notice how <i>Coletta</i> and <i>Opal</i> alternated between states
<tt>run</tt> and <tt>runble</tt>.
<pre>
<kbd>$ testschd</kbd>
<kbd>ctrl-p</kbd>
1 0 sleep  init
2 0 sleep  sh
3 100 sleep  testschd
4 50 runble Coletta

2 0 sleep  sh
3 100 sleep  testschd
4 50 run    Coletta
5 51 runble Opal
6 52 runble Florence
</pre>

<div class="question">
<p><b>10.</b> Given the above two instanced of <tt>ctrl-p</tt>, what scheduler (round-robin or priority)
is running and why?
</div>

<h3>Scheduler Tester - <tt>ctrl-g</tt></h3>
<p>The version of the kernel provided with this lab has a system call <tt>prochist()</tt> that displays
the process history captured in the <tt>prochist[]</tt> circular buffer. You should examine the
implementation of <tt>prochist()</tt> to determine it calls the function <tt>prochistory()</tt>, which
is in <tt>proc.c</tt>. User programs can make the <tt>prochist()</tt> system call. Additionally,
you can connect <tt>ctrl-g</tt> to <tt>prochistory()</tt>. I have done this in my demonstration
version of Xv6. For this lab, you must do the same. Once you have implemented <tt>ctrl-g</tt>, you can enter it
at any time to view the process history, which shows the first line as

<pre>
Tmr Rupts: 250, Sch Loops: 212295, Swtch Run: 210, Swtch New: 13, Switch Old: 182, Swtch sh: 15
</pre>

Followed by a sequence of lines, each of which contains

a round-robin scheduler.
<li>The number of timer interrupts is around 200. The exact number will vary per run.
<li>The number of new context switches is large - approximately 170. The exact number

</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since <tt>setpriority</tt> and <tt>getpriority</tt> are system calls,
you can review the steps for adding system calls at  
<a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a>.

<h3>Some Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since <tt>spoon()</tt> is a system call,
you can review the steps for adding system calls at  
<a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a>.

<h2>Implement a  Priority Scheduler <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Update Xv6 to include a priority scheduler with the follwoing attributes. 
<ul>
<li>The priority scheduler will be added to the function <tt>scheduler</tt> in the file <tt>proc.c</tt>
in the block corresponding to the code 
<pre>
else if (scheduler_policy == SCHED_PRIOR) {

<b>YOUR CODE HERE</b>

}
</pre>
Currently this block contains a duplication of the round-robin scheduler.
<li>Each process is assigned a priority that is placed in 
the member <tt>priority</tt> of its <tt>struct proc</tt>.
<li>The higher the number in the member <tt>priority</tt>, the better the priority. 
That is a process <i>Coletta</i> with a priority of 10 is better than 
a process <i>Opal</i> with a priority of 9, and if both are <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>, 
your algorithm must select <i>Coletta</i> to <tt>RUN</tt>.
<li>Processes will assign themselves a priority using the <tt>setpriority</tt> system call.
<li>Processes may retrieve their priority using the <tt>getpriority</tt> system call.
<li>Your implementation must appropriately call <tt>proc_hist()</tt> to add the selected
process to this process history. Examine 
<a href="#priorschdhist" >Sample <tt>tescschd.c</tt> Output for Priority Scheduler</a> for the output format.
<li>When multiple processes have the same highest priority, your scheduler shall 
execute them in a round-robin order.
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use your design created in your notebook for Question <b>Q9</b>. 
Do not attempt to implement your priority scheduler until you have 
completed a design and discussed it with me.
<li>A good design makes writing the code much easier.
<li>There is a requirement for performing round robin scheduling when procs have equal priority.
I found it easier to first implemented my priority scheduler without this implementation.
This meant that one of the equal priority procs would run to completion before the next.

<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> 
Read <a href="../labsubmissions.html" >Lab Submissions</a> for instructions on how
to submit your lab; however, you do not copy/paste the output of <tt>make grade</tt>
into your <tt>lab-scheduling-handin.txt</tt> file because Lab Scheduling does not have the <tt>make
grade</tt> tests because the output of <tt>testsched</tt> varies slightly.

<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<h3>Time spent</h3>

<p>Create a new file, <tt>time.txt</tt>, and put in a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab.
<kbd>git add</kbd> and <kbd>git commit</kbd> the file.

<h3>Answers</h3>

<p>If this lab had questions, write up your answers in <tt>answers-*.txt</tt>.
<kbd>git add</kbd> and <kbd>git commit</kbd> these files.

<h3>Submit</h3>

<p>Assignment submissions are handled by Gradescope.
You will need an MIT gradescope account.
See Piazza for the entry code to join the class.
Use <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/gi7gm49peg-student-add-course#joining_a_course_using_a_course_code">this link</a>
if you need more help joining.

<p>When you're ready to submit, run <kbd>make zipball</kbd>,
which will generate <tt>lab.zip</tt>.
Upload this zip file to the corresponding Gradescope assignment.

<p> If you run <kbd>make zipball</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked, i.e., not listed in a line that begins with <tt>??</tt>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<kbd>git add {filename}</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
<div class="warning">
<ul>
  <li>Please run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to ensure that your code passes all of the tests.
    The Gradescope autograder will use the same grading program to assign your submission a grade.</li>
  <li>Commit any modified source code before running <kbd>make zipball</kbd>.</li>
  <li>You can inspect the status of your submission and download the submitted
    code at Gradescope. The Gradescope lab grade is your final lab grade.</li>
