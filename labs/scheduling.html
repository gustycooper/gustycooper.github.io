<h1>Lab: Scheduling</h1>

<p>In this lab you will implement a priority scheduler for xv6. 
<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you begin lab scheduling, 
<ul>
<li>Read "Chapter 7: Scheduling" in the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">xv6 book</a>.
<li>Read Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in 
  <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OS Three Easy Pieces</a>
</ul>
</div>
   
<div class="warning">
<p>
<b>For this lab, be sure to invoke make as <kbd>$ make CPUS=1 qemu</kbd>.</b>
<p>This allows your priority scheduler to demonstrate scheduling with priorities without the complications of multiple CPUS.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. You will state the percentage of questions answered on your lab submission.
<p>The Linux <tt>grep</tt> command can be helpful on some questions. For example, suppose a question asks you about the <tt>struct proc</tt>. You can discover the definition and uses of the <tt>struct proc</tt> by issuing the following Linux <tt>grep</tt> command in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
<pre>
$ <kbd>grep "struct proc" *.h</kbd>
defs.h:struct proc;
defs.h:pagetable_t     proc_pagetable(struct proc *);
defs.h:int             killed(struct proc*);
defs.h:void            setkilled(struct proc*);
defs.h:struct proc*    myproc();
proc.h:  struct proc *proc;          // The process running on this cpu, or null.
proc.h:struct proc {
proc.h:  struct proc *parent;         // Parent process
proc.h:struct prochist {
% <kbd>grep "struct proc" *.c</kbd>
exec.c:  struct proc *p = myproc();
file.c:  struct proc *p = myproc();
pipe.c:  struct proc *pr = myproc();
... lots of matches
sysproc.c:  struct proc* p = myproc();
trap.c:  struct proc *p = myproc();
trap.c:  struct proc *p = myproc();
</pre>
</div>
<div class="required">
<p>In the directory of your xv6-labs, create two files: <b>answers-scheduling.txt</b> and <b>time.txt</b> that I may use 
if I run your code using your zip file submission. The answers-scheduling.txt is a blank file. The time.txt file contains
the number of hours you spent on the lab.

</div>


<p>Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the <tt>scheduling</tt> branch:

</pre>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Xv6's <tt>proc.h</tt> and <tt>proc.c</tt></h3>
<p>The files <tt>proc.h</tt> and <tt>proc.c</tt> contain the data structures and algorithms
used to implement Xv6's process model. The data structure <tt>struct proc</tt> defines process information
that Xv6 uses. When performing Lab syscall, you added members to <tt>struct proc</tt>.
For Lab Scheduling, I have added members to <tt>struct proc</tt> and code to <tt>proc.c</tt>.
<ul>
<li><tt>struct proc</tt> has a member <tt>int priority</tt> that you will use.
<li><tt>proc.h</tt> has a <tt>struct prochist</tt> for maintaining a cirucular buffer of
procs that are scheduled.
<li><tt>proc.c</tt> has a function <tt>proc_hist()</tt> that when called adds information to
the <tt>prochist[]</tt> circular buffer.
<li><tt>param.h</tt> has two macros used for selecting a scheduling policy.
<pre>
#define SCHED_RR      0  // Round-Robin Scheduler
#define SCHED_PRIOR   1  // Priority-Based Scheduler
</pre>
<li><tt>proc.c</tt> has a static variable <tt>int schedular_policy</tt> that can be set to
either <tt>SCHED_RR</tt> for a round-robin scheduler or <tt>SCHED_PRIOR</tt> for a 
priority scheduler.
<li><tt>proc.c</tt> has an updated <tt>scheduler()</tt> function that includes a conditional
statement to select a scheduling policy based on the value of the variable <tt>schedular_policy</tt>.
As provided the conditional executes the original Xv6 round-robin scheduler for both conditions.
You will update the <tt>SCHED_PRIOR</tt> condition to be a priority scheduler.
<li>The updated <tt>scheduler()</tt> in <tt>proc.c</tt> calls <tt>proc_hist()</tt> to add information
to <tt>prochist[]</tt>.
</ul>
<h3>Xv6 Process States</h3>
<p>The file <tt>proc.h</tt> defines the enumerated type <tt>procstate</tt> as follows.

<pre>
enum procstate { UNUSED, USED, SLEEPING, RUNNABLE, RUNNING, ZOMBIE };
</pre>

<p>Processes have a state diagram that is summarized as follows. 
<p>

<img src="procstates_1.png" alt="Process States" >

<div class="question">
<p><b>1.</b> Draw the above diagram in your notebook.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>2.</b> Provide two examples of something a process can do that causes it to transition from
<tt>RUNNING</tt> to <tt>SLEEPING</tt>.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>3.</b> Provide two example events that cause a process to transition from
<tt>SLEEPING</tt> to <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>4.</b> There is an arrow in the state diagram labeled with Scheduled and Descheduled.
What function in Xv6 performs this arrow?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>5.</b> What function in Xv6 performs the transition from Sleeping to Runnable?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>6.</b> Why do you think a process cannot transition from Sleeping to Running?
</div>

<p>The scheduling algorithm
searches a list of <i>Runnable</i> processes, selects the next process to run, and <i>runs</i> it.
Running a process involves a context switch, which is described in the next section. 
The scheduling algorithm performs both the <i>Scheduled</i> arrow and the <i>Descheduled</i> arrows.
The arrow labeled <i>Scheduled</i> moves a process from <i>Runnable</i> to <i>Running</i>, while at 
the same time the arrow labeled <i>Descheduled</i> moves the <i>Running</i> process back to 
the list of <i>Runnable</i> processes.

<p>You will notice that <tt>procstate</tt> defines three additional states <tt>UNUSED</tt>, <tt>USED</tt>,
and <tt>ZOMBIE</tt>. An <tt>UNUSED</tt> proc is available to be allocated. A proc is temporarily in
the <tt>USED</tt> state until it is finally aloocated when it becomes <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>. 

<div class="question">
<p><b>7.</b> Look up what it means a Linux process to be in a <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state. Write the answer 
and create a program that results in a process in a <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state. Use the Xv6 <tt>ctrl-p</tt>
command to demonstrate your program results in a process that is in the <tt>ZOMBIE</tt> state.
Since the program is such a few lines, hand write the code in your notebook.
</div>

<p>Another terminology for process states is <i>Running</i>, <i>Ready</i>, and <i>Blocked</i>.
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OS Three Easy Pieces</a> uses this terminology.
The following is a process state transition diagram using these terms.
<p>

<img src="procstates_2.png" alt="Process States" >

<h3>Xv6 Scheduler</h3>

<p>Xv6 supports a maximum 64 concurrent processes, and they are defined in the array <tt>struct proc proc[NPROC];</tt>
where <tt>param.h</tt> contains <tt>#define NPROC 64</tt>, and
<tt>proc.h</tt> contains the definition of a <tt>struct proc</tt>. <tt>struc proc</tt> has many members, one of 
which is <tt>enum procstate state;</tt>. The function <tt>procinit()</tt> in <tt>proc.c</tt> initializes all
of the <tt>struct proc</tt> elements in the array <tt>proc[]</tt> to <tt>UNUSED</tt>. 
An allocated process (<tt>allocproc()</tt> is briefly in the <tt>USED</tt> state   
until it is made <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>.

<div class="question">
<p><b>8.</b>  As stated above the scheduler has a list of Runnable procs. 
The sheduler uses it scheduling algorithm to select the next proc to run from the list of Runnable procs.
Describe the ready list used by Xv6.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>9.</b> Why do you think <tt>allocproc()</tt> used the intermediate state <tt>USED</tt>? You will have to 
examine the code to answer this.
</div>

<p>The Xv6 <tt>scheduler()</tt> iterates through the <tt>struct proc proc[]</tt> array searching
for a <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> process. Once the scheduling algorithm selects a <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> process, Xv6
performs a context switch from the <tt>scheduler</tt> to the selected process. Context switches are
a key component in operating systems. A timer interrupt causes the scheduling algorithm to run.
Consider that the OS is currenting executing process <i>Coletta</i> when a timer interrupt occurs.
First a context switch from <i>Coletta</i> to the <tt>scheduler</tt> must occur. Then, after
the <tt>scheduler</tt> has selected <i>Opal</i> to run, a context switch from the <tt>scheduler</tt>
to <i>Opal</i> must occur. Once Xv6 has booted, the <tt>scheduler</tt> enters an endless loop
searching for <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> processes and performing context switches to them. 
The <tt>scheduler</tt> runs in kernel mode.
Xv6 creates the <tt>initproc</tt>, and the <tt>scheduler</tt> runs it (i.e., performs a context switch). 
The <tt>initproc</tt> creates the <tt>sh</tt> (shell) process, and the <tt>scheduler</tt> runs it.

<h3>Xv6 Shell and User Programs</h3>

The shell is our user interface to Xv6. The shell allows you to enter commands. 
The shell <tt>fork</tt>s these commands as children processes, and like a good parent, waits for its children to finish. 
Each command is a program located on the Xv6 disk. 
The programs are created by the <tt>Makefile</tt> from the <tt>.c</tt> files in the <tt>user</tt> directory.
Each program is created by linking together several object files. Consider the <tt>ls</tt> program.
<ul>
<li><tt>ls.c</tt> creates <tt>ls.o</tt>
<li><tt>ulib.c</tt> creates <tt>ulib.o</tt>
<li><tt>usys.pl</tt> creates <tt>usys.S</tt> creates <tt>usys.o</tt>
<li><tt>ls.o</tt>, <tt>ulib.o</tt>, <tt>usys.o</tt> are linked together into the <tt>ls</tt> program.
</ul>

<div class="question">
<p><b>10.</b> When you want to add a new user program to Xv6, what must you do the the Makefile?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>11.</b> What code is located in <tt>ulib</tt>?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>12.</b> What code is located in <tt>usys</tt>?
</div>

The shell performs a two step sequence to run each command.
<ul>
<li>Call <tt>fork()</tt> to create a duplicate shell process.
<li>Call <tt>exec()</tt> to replace the duplicate shell with the command's program.
The call to <tt>exec()</tt> is performed in the child's portion of the <tt>fork</tt>'s if statement.
The parent calls <tt>wait()</tt> in its portion of the <tt>fork</tt>'s if statement.
</ul>
  
<h3>Xv6 Context Switches</h3>

<p> The following diagrams displays a context switch from a process <i>Coletta</i> to a process <i>Opal</i>.
<p>
<img src="contextswitch.png" alt="Context Switch" >

<p>
There is a lot to digest in the above simple-looking context switch diagram. The process <i>Coletta</i> is running
in user mode, when a timer interrupt occurs, which is the OS interrupt used for a context switch.
On the RISCV architecture, the timer interrupt is immediately processed in machine mode by <tt>timervec()</tt> 
(in <tt>kernelvec.S</tt>), which
issues a software interrupt that is processed by <tt>uservec()</tt> (in <tt>trampoline.S</tt>). 
The RISCV CPU is now in supervisor 
mode, but the CPU is still using the page table of <i>Coletta</i> - not the OS page table. 
The code for <tt>uservec()</tt> is on the <i>trampoline</i> page, the virtual address of which is mapped 
in each user proc's page table. 
<i>Coletta</i>'s <i>trampoline</i> page is marked to allow execution in supervisor mode.
To refresh your memory on memory layout, you can examine <tt>memlayout.h</tt> and Figure 3.3 
of <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">our xv6 text book</a>, which was part of our page table studies.
Having the <i>trampoline</i> page mapped to <i>Coletta</i>'s page table allows <tt>uservec()</tt> 
to begin executing in supervisor mode prior to changin to the 
OS page table, which also maps the virtual address <i>trampoline</i> page to the same address. 
Thus <tt>uservec()</tt> can switch to the OS page table and continue executing the <i>trampoline</i> code. 
Before switching to the OS page table, <tt>uservec</tt>
saves all registers in <i>Coletta</i>'s TRAPFRAME. Each process has a unique physical page allocated as its
TRAPFRAME. Each process's TRAPFRAME is mapped to the same virtual address, which allows <tt>uservec()</tt> to
save the registers. The process's <tt>struc proc</tt> member <tt>p->trapframe</tt> 
points to the trapframe with its physical address, which allows the kernel to access the process's
TRAPFRAME using the kernel page table because the kernel's page table maps a virtual address to its corresponding
physical address. For example, the kernel's page table maps the virtual page number <tt>0x80000</tt> to the
physical page number <tt>0x80000</tt>.

<div class="question">
<p><b>13.</b> Given kernel virtual address of <tt>0x80000b0b</tt>, what is its corresponding physical address?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>14.</b> What is the virtual address of the TRAMPOLINE page?
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>15.</b> Explain the processing of a timer interrupt in your own words.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>16.</b> <tt>uservec()</tt> in <tt>trampoline.S</tt> begins execution using a process page table
and transitions to the OS page table.
<ul>
<li>How is is possible to use a process page table when the interrupt is in kernel mode?
<li>What register is changed to transition from the process page table to the kernel page table?
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><b>17.</b> Draw Figure 3-4 from  <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf">our xv6 text book</a> in your notebook.
<ul>
<li>Is this a mapping of a process's virtual address space or physical address space?
<li>Where are the TRAMPOLINE and TRAPEFRAME pages located?
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Xv6's Round Robin Scheduler</h3>
<p>The Xv6 function <tt>scheduler()</tt> in the file <tt>proc.c</tt> implements a round robin scheduler.

<div class="question">
<p><b>18.</b> Explain how the algorithm in <tt>scheduler()</tt> implements a round robin scheduler.
NOTE: The answer is a little trickier than you may think.
</div>

<h3>Xv6's Priority Scheduler</h3>
<p>You will implement a priority scheduler.

<div class="question">
<p><b>19.</b> Create a design for your priority scheduler. You must complete this before you begin
implementing the code for your priority scheduler.
</div>

<h3>Scheduler Tester - <tt>testschd.c</tt></h3>
I have provided <tt>testschd.c</tt> to test scheduler algorithms. The program creates three processes
with varying priorities. The processes have names <i>Coletta</i>, <i>Opal</i>, and <i>Florence</i>.
Their default priorites are 
<ul>
<li><i>Coletta</i> - 50
<li><i>Opal</i> - 51
<li><i>Florence</i> - 52
</ul>
The priorities can be changed by invoking 
<pre>
<kbd> $ testschd 20 3 31</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The <tt>testschd.c</tt> program calls the system call function <tt>spoon()</tt>, which is exactly like <tt>fork()</tt>, 
but <tt>spoon()</tt> allows you to name the function. The function name is copied into the 
<tt>struct proc</tt> member <tt>name</tt>. Without <tt>spoon()</tt> all of the processes of <tt>testsched</tt> 
would have the name of their parent - e.g., they would be named <tt>testschd</tt>.

<p>You must implement <tt>spoon()</tt> before <tt>testschd.c</tt> will run. Or you can change the calls to
<tt>spoon</tt> to be calls to <tt>fork</tt> to temporarily run the program, but you must implement <tt>spoon()</tt>
before completing the lab.

<p><a name="controlp"></>
<h3>Scheduler Tester - <tt>ctrl-p</tt> </h3>
<p>Xv6 provides a <tt>ctrl-p</tt> that shows processes and their states. <tt>ctrl-p</tt> is similar to 
Linux <tt>ps</tt> command.
<p>You can enter <tt>ctrl-p</tt> at any time and it displays
<pre>
proc_id priority state name
</pre>

<p>The following shows entering <tt>ctrl-p</tt> while <tt>testschd</tt> is running. The display shows the
processes pid, priority, state, and name. Notice the various states of <tt>sleep</tt>, <tt>runble</tt>,
and <tt>run</tt>. This was done on a Xv6 build with <tt>CPUS=1</tt> so there is only one process in
the state <tt>run</tt>. Also notice how <i>Coletta</i> and <i>Opal</i> alternated between states
<tt>run</tt> and <tt>runble</tt>.
<pre>
<kbd>$ testschd</kbd>
<kbd>ctrl-p</kbd>

2 0 sleep  sh
3 100 sleep  testschd
4 50 run    Coletta
5 51 runble Opal
6 52 runble Florence
</pre>

<div class="question">
<p><b>20.</b> Given the above two instances of <tt>ctrl-p</tt>, what scheduler (round-robin or priority)
is running and why?
</div>

<h3>Scheduler Tester - <tt>ctrl-g</tt></h3>
<p>The version of the kernel provided with this lab has a system call <tt>prochist()</tt> that displays
the process history captured in the <tt>prochist[]</tt> circular buffer. You should examine the
implementation of <tt>prochist()</tt> to determine it calls the function <tt>prochistory()</tt>, which
is in <tt>proc.c</tt>. User programs can make the <tt>prochist()</tt> system call. Additionally,
you can connect <tt>ctrl-g</tt> to <tt>prochistory()</tt>. I have done this in my demonstration
version of Xv6. For this lab, you must do the same. Once you have implemented <tt>ctrl-g</tt>, you can enter it
at any time to view the process history, which shows the first line as

<pre>
Tmr Rupts: 250, Sch Loops: 212295, Swtch Run: 210, Swtch New: 13, Switch Old: 182, Swtch sh: 15
</pre>

Followed by a sequence of lines, each of which contains

<pre>
index: cpu proc_id priority name priority
</pre>

<div class="question">
<p><b>21.</b> Explain in your own words how the circular buffer of process history is implemented.

<ul>
<li>The children are started in order child 4, child 5, and child 6.
<li>The call to <tt>prochist()</tt> shows continuous alternation of execution between

a round-robin scheduler.
<li>The number of timer interrupts is around 200. The exact number will vary per run.
<li>The number of new context switches is large - approximately 170. The exact number

<h2>Problem 2: Implement the <tt>setpriority/getpriority</tt> System Calls <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Update Xv6 to include two systems calls: <tt>setpriority</tt> and <tt>getpriority</tt>.
From the user program perspective, the function protypes are
<pre>
int setpriority(int);

<p>When a process calls <tt>getpriority</tt>, the value in the the member
<tt>priority</tt> of its <tt>struct proc</tt> is returned.
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since <tt>setpriority</tt> and <tt>getpriority</tt> are system calls,
you can review the steps for adding system calls at  
<a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a>.
<li> Add <tt>setpriority</tt> and <tt>getpriority</tt> to <tt>sysproc.c</tt>.
<li> You can examine <tt>testschd.c</tt> for sample calls to <tt>setpriority</tt>
and <tt>getpriority</tt>.
<li> Create test code to ensure your <tt>setpriority</tt> and <tt>getpriority</tt> work.

<ul>
<li>Since <tt>spoon()</tt> is a system call,
you can review the steps for adding system calls at  
<a href="syscall.html#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a>.

<h2>Problem 4: Implement a  Priority Scheduler <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Update Xv6 to include a priority scheduler with the follwoing attributes. 
<ul>
<li>The priority scheduler will be added to the function <tt>scheduler</tt> in the file <tt>proc.c</tt>
in the block corresponding to the code 
<pre>
else if (scheduler_policy == SCHED_PRIOR) {

}
</pre>
Currently this block contains a duplication of the round-robin scheduler.
<li>Each process is assigned a priority that is placed in 
the member <tt>priority</tt> of its <tt>struct proc</tt>.
<li>The higher the number in the member <tt>priority</tt>, the better the priority. 
That is a process <i>Coletta</i> with a priority of 10 is better than 
a process <i>Opal</i> with a priority of 9, and if both are <tt>RUNNABLE</tt>, 
your algorithm must select <i>Coletta</i> to <tt>RUN</tt>.
<li>Processes will assign themselves a priority using the <tt>setpriority</tt> system call.
<li>Processes may retrieve their priority using the <tt>getpriority</tt> system call.
<li>Your implementation must appropriately call <tt>proc_hist()</tt> to add the selected
process to this process history. Examine 
<a href="#priorschdhist" >Sample <tt>tescschd.c</tt> Output for Priority Scheduler</a> for the output format.
<li>When multiple processes have the same highest priority, your scheduler shall 
execute them in a round-robin order.
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use your design created in your notebook for Question <b>Q9</b>. 
Do not attempt to implement your priority scheduler until you have 
completed a design and discussed it with me.
<li>A good design makes writing the code much easier.
<li>There is a requirement for performing round robin scheduling when procs have equal priority.
I found it easier to first implemented my priority scheduler without this implementation.
This meant that one of the equal priority procs would run to completion before the next.
</ul>

<div class="required">
<p>After you have finished your priority scheduler, run 
<pre>
$ <kbd>testschd</kbd>

<h2>Fair Schedulers</h2>
<div class="warning">
<p>
<p>This section does not have any questions, but I will include a question about the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler on the lab checkoff. The question will probably involve comparing LCFS to the lottery or stride scheduler.
</div>

<div class="required">
<p>This section provides a cursory treatment of the schedulers. You will have to be sure to read
<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-mlfq.pdf">OSTEP Ch 8: MLFQ</a> and
<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf">OSTEP Ch 9: Lottery</a> 
and/or ask questions in class about these schedulers.
</div>


<p>A fair scheduler attempts to be <i>fair</i> to processes. <i>Fair</i> means that processes get to run their <i>fair</i> amount based upon some priority.
The priorities can be assigned by individuals (people) or computed based upon the history of the process's execution. The MLFQ uses execution history to assign priorities. Lottery, Stride, and Linux Completely Fair schedulers rely on individual to assign process priorities.

<p>A scheduler runs a process for a <i>timeslice</i> (also called a <i>quantum</i>). A <i>timeslice</i> is a specific number of miliseconds. 
For example, <i>timeslice</i> may be 45, 50, or 100 miliseconds.
<h3>Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduler</h3>

<p>The Multilevel Feedback Queue scheduler uses execution history to establish processes' priorities. All processes begin with the highest priority. If a process consumes its entire timeslice, its priority is lowered. This is done with multiple levels of priority queues.
<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-mlfq.pdf">OS Three Easy Pieces, Ch 8: MLFQ</a> describes the Multilevel Feedback Queue scheduler.
The following the MLFQ rules are from Chapter 8, page 10.

<ul>
<li>Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs (B doesn't).
<li>Rule 2: If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A and B run in round-robin fashion using the time slice (quantum length) of the given queue.
<li>Rule 3: When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue).
<li>Rule 4: Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU), its priority is
reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).
<li>Rule 5: After some time period of time, move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue.
</ul>

<h3>Lottery Scheduler</h3>

<p><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf">OSTEP, Ch 9: Lottery</a> describes the lottery scheduler.
Processes are assigned tickets that allocate the process's share of the CPU. 
For example, if there are two RUNNABLE processes - P1 and P2, where P1 has 100 tickets and P2 has 200 tickets, the P2 runs twice as much as P1.
The algorithm is really simple, and it is given by the following.
<pre>
int winner = getrandom(0, totaltickets);
node_t *current = head;
while (current) {
    counter = counter + current->tickets;
    if (counter > winner)
        break; // found the winner
    current = current->next;
}
</pre>
Over time, the processes with more tickets will win the lottery more times that processes with less tickets. 
This means the processes with more tickets will run more timeslices the the processes with less tickets.
However, in a short sampling period, the lottery scheduler may not exhibit the desired fairness. 
Since it relies on a random number, the lottery scheduler may run a ticket with less tickets more than it should.
<h3>Stride Scheduler</h3>
<p><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf">OSTEP, Ch 9: Lottery</a> describes the stride scheduler.
The stride scheduler is a deterministic fair scheduler.
<h3>Linux Completely Fair Scheduler</h3>
<p><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf">OSTEP, Ch 9: Lottery</a> describes the Linux Completely Fair scheduler.
LCFS is unique in that it assigns longer time slices to processes with higher priorities, whereas, 
the lottery and stride fair schedulers run processes with higher priorities more time slices.
<p>The priority in LCFS is its <i>nice</i> value. Linux has a <tt>nice</tt> command and a <tt>nice()</tt> system call that can
be used to adjust the <i>nice</i> values of processes.
The <i>nice</i> values range from -20 to 20, which -20 having the highest priority and 20 having the lowest.
The <i>nice</i> value is used to select a <i>weight</i> that is used in a forumla to compute the process's timeslice.

<pre>
static const int nice_to_weight[40] = {
/* -20 */ 88761, 71755, 56483, 46273, 36291, 
/* -15 */ 29154, 23254, 18705, 14949, 11916,
/* -10 */  9548,  7620,  6100,  4904,  3906,
/*  -5 */  3121,  2501,  1991,  1586,  1277,
/*   0 */  1024,   820,   655,   526,   423,
/*   5 */   335,   272,   215,   172,   137, 
/*  10 */   110,    87,    70,    56,    45, 
/*  15 */    36,    29,    23,    18,    15,
};
</pre>

<p>The value schedule latency (<i>schedlatency</i>) is the number of miliseconds that divvied among the processes that are <i>RUNNABLE</i>.
For example, if <i>schedlatency</i> is 100 milliseconds and four processes, each with the same <i>nice</i> value of 0, are <i>RUNNABLE</i>, 
each would be allocated a 25 millisecond timeslice.
<p>Suppose there are <b>N</b> <i>RUNNABLE</i> processes, The formula to compute the <i>timeslice<sub>k</sub></i> for <var>process<sub>k</sub></var> is given by the following.

<p><var>timeslice<sub>k</sub></var> = 
<var>weight<sub>k</sub></var> / <tt>sum</tt>(<var>weight<sub>i</sub></var> <sub>for i</i><tt>=1..N</tt></sub>) * <var>schedlatency</var>

<p>The formula may seem intimidating, but an example exposes the simplicity of the formula.

<p>Consider there are two <i>RUNNABLE</i> processes, P1 and P2 and the <i>schedlatency</i> is 100 milliseconds. 
P1 has a <i>nice</i> value of -5, which is a weight of 3121.
P2 has a <i>nice</i> value of 0, which is a weight of 1024.
<p>You should observe that P1 has a weight (priority) that is approximately 3 times that of P2.
<p>The formula will assign a timeslice to P1 that is approximately 75 millisecond and a timeslice to P2 that is 25 milliseconds.
<p>The exact values computed by the formula are the following.
<ul>
<li>The summatioan of the two weights is 3121 + 1024, which is 4145
<li>P1 time slice 3121/4145 * 100ms = 75.3ms
<li>P2 time slice 1024/4145 * 100ms = 24.7ms
</ul>

<p>Virtual Runtime is the last piece of this puzzle. When it is time to select the process to move from <i>RUNNABLE</i> to <i>RUNNING</i>,
LCFS selects the process with the smallest <i>virtual runtime</i>, which is defined by the following formula.

<p><var>vruntime<sub>i</sub></var> = <var>vruntime<sub>i</sub></var> + <var>weight<sub>0</sub></var>/<var>weight<sub>i</sub></var> * 
<var>runtime<sub>i</sub></var>

<p>It is important to observe the the vruntime of the two processes P1 and P2 increase exactly the same, which is 24.7. This means that the algorithm is selecting the one with the smallest vruntime, will be a round-robin between the two. This means that P1 runs for 75ms, P2 runs for 25ms, P1 runs for 75ms and so on. Thus achieving the desired fairness when P1 runs 3 times as much as P2.
<ul>
<li>
P1 vruntime = vruntime + 1024/3121*runtime
<br>0 + 24.7
<li>
P1 vruntime = vruntime + 1024/1024*runtime
<br>0 + 24.7
</ul>

<p><b>LCFS Practice Problem</b>
<p>This problem considers a Linux Completely Fair Scheduler that has the following table of nice values.

<pre>
static const int nice_to_weight[40] = { // negative – higher prior
 /* -20 */     88761,     71755,     56483,     46273,     36291,
 /* -15 */     29154,     23254,     18705,     14949,     11916,
 /* -10 */      9548,      7620,      6100,      4904,      3906,
 /*  -5 */      3121,      2501,      1991,      1586,      1277,
 /*   0 */      1024,       820,       655,       526,       423,
 /*   5 */       335,       272,       215,       172,       137,
 /*  10 */       110,        87,        70,        56,        45,
 /*  15 */        36,        29,        23,        18,        15,
};
</pre>

Your system has three computational processes with process ids 2021, 2022, and 2023 that are executing with nice values of 0. They are running for a long time. You can change the nice value of a process using the renice command. The following changes process id 2021 to have a nice of -1.

<pre>
$ sudo renice -n -1 -p 2021
</pre>

<p>Use the renice command with appropriate nice values to change the nice value of processes 2021, 2022, and 2023 such that process id 2021 runs twice as much as process id 2022, and process id 2022 runs twice as much as process id 2023. The nice values may not exactly translate to twice as much, but they can be close. Add commentary to your answer that explains what you are doing and why.
