<h1>Lab: security</h1>

<p>The Security Lab is different than our other labs.

<div class="prereq">
<p>For this lab, you answer questions in your notebook and we discuss your answers during our Security Lab class.
Students must answer the questions such that they can lead a discussion on these topics. Students should study all topics. 
The class may organize itself where specific students have been assigned topics to lead. 
I may use my random student selector to select students to lead discussion topics.
Use the Internet and OSTEP Security Section to collect information about these basic security concepts. 
When studying the concepts consider their relationships to operating systems and the material we have learned.
Students must be in class and active participants. Students are not allowed to fiddle with their laptops or with their phones or any other electronic devices.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Use your notebook answers to participate during our class discussion.

  <h2>Secure Design <script>g("easy")</script></h2>
<p>Most existing software was designed well, but often did not consider vulnerabilities. As a result, a lot of cybersecurity is (1) “patching” existing code after a vulnerability is discovered and (2) building (selling) tools to guard existing systems. Tools are things like Norton, McAfee, port blockers, etc. We are playing whack-a-mole. Hackers discover a vulnerability. We discover that a hacker has intruded. We create a patch/tool to fix the vulnerability. As new systems are created, it is important to use a secure design. I think the definition of a secure design is evolving. The following topics are part of the evolving definition of secure design. Discover answers to these terms and write them in your notebook. OSTEP Chapter 53 will be helpful for these terms.
