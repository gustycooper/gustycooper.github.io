<h1>Lab: security</h1>

<p>The Security Lab is different than our other labs.

<div class="prereq">
<p>For this lab, you answer questions in your notebook and we discuss your answers during our Security Lab class.
Students must answer the questions such that they can lead a discussion on these topics. Students should study all topics. 
The class may organize itself where specific students have been assigned topics to lead. 
I may use my random student selector to select students to lead discussion topics.
Use the Internet and OSTEP Security Section to collect information about these basic security concepts. 
When studying the concepts consider their relationships to operating systems and the material we have learned.
Students must be in class and active participants. Students are not allowed to fiddle with their laptops or with their phones or any other electronic devices.
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Use your notebook answers to participate during our class discussion.

  <h2>Secure Design <script>g("easy")</script></h2>
<p>Most existing software was designed well, but often did not consider vulnerabilities. As a result, a lot of cybersecurity is (1) “patching” existing code after a vulnerability is discovered and (2) building (selling) tools to guard existing systems. Tools are things like Norton, McAfee, port blockers, etc. We are playing whack-a-mole. Hackers discover a vulnerability. We discover that a hacker has intruded. We create a patch/tool to fix the vulnerability. As new systems are created, it is important to use a secure design. I think the definition of a secure design is evolving. The following topics are part of the evolving definition of secure design. Discover answers to these terms and write them in your notebook. OSTEP Chapter 53 will be helpful for these terms.
  <div class="question">
<b>16.</b> Economy of mechanism

<p><a name="submit"></>
<h2>Submit the lab</h2>

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> You do not have to submit this lab. Please come to class prepared to discuss your answers.

<!--
<h3>Time spent</h3>

<p>Create a new file, <tt>time.txt</tt>, and put in a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab.
<kbd>git add</kbd> and <kbd>git commit</kbd> the file.

<h3>Answers</h3>

<p>If this lab had questions, write up your answers in <tt>answers-*.txt</tt>.
<kbd>git add</kbd> and <kbd>git commit</kbd> these files.

<h3>Submit</h3>

<p>Assignment submissions are handled by Gradescope.
You will need an MIT gradescope account.
See Piazza for the entry code to join the class.
Use <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/gi7gm49peg-student-add-course#joining_a_course_using_a_course_code">this link</a>
if you need more help joining.

<p>When you're ready to submit, run <kbd>make zipball</kbd>,
which will generate <tt>lab.zip</tt>.
Upload this zip file to the corresponding Gradescope assignment.

<p> If you run <kbd>make zipball</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked, i.e., not listed in a line that begins with <tt>??</tt>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<kbd>git add {filename}</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
<div class="warning">
<ul>
  <li>Please run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to ensure that your code passes all of the tests.</li>
  <li>Commit any modified source code before running <kbd>make zipball</kbd>.</li>
  <li>You can inspect the status of your submission and download the submitted
    code at Gradescope. The Gradescope lab grade is your final lab grade.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Print the names of the functions and line numbers
  in <tt>backtrace()</tt> instead of numerical
  addresses <script>g("hard")</script>.</li>
