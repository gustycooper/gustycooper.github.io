<h1>Lab: system calls</h1>

<p>In the last lab you used system calls to write a few utilities. In
this lab you will add some new system calls to xv6, which will help
you understand how they work and will expose you to some of the
internals of the xv6 kernel.  You will add more system calls in later
labs.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you begin lab system calls, read Chapter 2 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and
    Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter 4, and
  related source files:

  <ul>

    <li> The user-space "stubs" that route system calls into the kernel are in <tt>user/usys.S</tt>,
      which is generated by <tt>user/usys.pl</tt> when you run <tt>make</tt>.
      Declarations are in <tt>user/user.h</tt>

    <li> The kernel-space code that routes a system call to the
    kernel function that implements it
    is in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt> and <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>.

    <li> Process-related code is <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt> and <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.

  </ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>In this lab, there are several questions for you to answer. Questions are in boxes with a light orange background. 
Write each question and its answer in your notebook. Take photo(s) of your questions/answers and submit the photo(s) on Canvas.
Additionally, in the directory of your xv6-labs, create the file: <b>answers-syscall.txt</b>. You do not need to put answers in 
this file, but the grading script checks to see if this file exists. If it exists, I assume you have answered the questions
in your notebook.

<p>Xv6 has a small collection of system calls, which are used to create utility programs. Using the system calls, you can create programs that open, close, and read files; create and delete files and directories; create processes; communicate between processes using pipes, read, and write; and execute programs. The API for Xv6 system calls are shown in yellow in the following table. In this lab you create the Xv6 system calls shown in red.

<h2>Reference: Xv6 System Calls</h2>
This section provides a reference of steps to add system calls to Xv6.
You do not have to study these steps prior to performing the lab, becuase 
the individual portions of the lab, contain instructions for performing these steps.
In later labs, when you have to add a system call, you can refer to these steps.
There is not a specific order to these steps; however, they all must be completed
in order to run Xv6 with the newly added system call.
In the following steps, a ficticious system call <tt><b>dosys</b></tt> is added.
  <ul>
    <li><p><b><tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt></b>: Add a syscall number to <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>. <tt>syscall.h</tt> is a sequence of C macros. 
     The <tt><b>dosys</b></tt> macro would be the following, where the number 22 is the next number.<br>
<tt>#define SYS_dosys  22</tt><br>
    </li> 
    <li><p><b><tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt></b>: Add <tt><b>dosys</b></tt> information to <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt>. 
     <tt>syscall.c</tt> has the fucntion <tt>syscall</tt> that is called from <tt>trap</tt>. The function
     <tt>syscall</tt> determines which system call has been called, retrieves arguments, and makes the call.
     <tt>syscall.c</tt> has function prototypes for each system call and an array (<tt>syscalls[]</tt>) of function pointers
     that point to the various system calls. The array of function pointers uses the <tt>SYS_dosys</tt>
     number to place the address of the <tt>sys_dosys</tt> function in the array. The system call number
     is placed in register <tt>a7</tt> by <tt>usys.S</tt> prior to calling the function <tt>syscall</tt>.
     You can examine the code in <tt>syscall.c</tt> to see the following statements to call the correct
     system call.
<pre>
struct proc *p = myproc();          // proc that made system call
int num = p->trapframe->a7;         // retrieve system call num
p->trapframe->a0 = syscalls[num](); // call function, save ret val in reg a0
</pre>
    </li> 
    <li><p><b><tt>user/user.h</tt></b>: Add prototype for the <tt><b>dosys</b></tt> system call to <tt>user/user.h</tt> 
     The file <tt>user.h</tt> provides a seqence of function prototypes that serve as the API for system calls.
     User utility programs like <tt>ls</tt> and <tt>cat</tt> include <tt>user.h</tt> to access the API.
     The file <tt>user.h</tt> also has function prototypes for functions that are in 
     <tt>ulib.c</tt>. The <tt>ulib.c</tt> functions can be called directly, and the include  
     functions such as <tt>strcpy</tt> and <tt>printf</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><p><b><tt>user/usys.pl</tt></b>: Add a stub to <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>
     The <tt>Makefile</tt> invokes the perl script <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, which produces <tt>user/usys.S</tt>,
     the actual system call stubs, which use the RISC-V <tt>ecall</tt> instruction to transition from user mode to the
     kernel mode. If you examine the code in <tt>usys.pl</tt>, you will discover the system call number is
     placed in register <tt>a7</tt> prior to executing the <tt>ecall</tt> instruction.</li>
    <li><p><b><tt>dosys</tt> Implementation</b>: <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> is the entry point system calls. 
     For some system calls, the entire implementation is in <tt>sysproc.c</tt>. For example, you will place
     your implementation of <tt>rinter</tt> in the function <tt>sys_rinter()</tt> in <tt>sysproc.c</tt>.
     However, other system calls such as <tt>fork()</tt> the implementation is located in <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>, and the 
     <tt>sys_fork()</tt> function simply calls <tt>fork()</tt>.
    <li><p><b>Testing/<tt>Makefile</tt></b>: You will have to create a user program to
     test your syscall implementation. Add <tt>$U/_dosystest</tt> to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt>.
      To test your <tt><b>dosys</b></tt> system call, 
      create your test cases program in <tt>user/dosystest.c</tt>.
      Then add <tt>$U/_dosystest</tt> to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt>.
     </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Starting the Lab <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the syscall branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout syscall</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>

<p>If you run <tt>make grade</tt> you will see that the grading script cannot
exec
  <tt>trace</tt> and <tt>sysinfotest</tt>.  Your job is to add the
  necessary system calls and stubs to make them work.

<h2>Using gdb <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>In many cases, print statements will be sufficient to debug your
kernel, but sometimes being able to single step through some assembly
code or inspecting the variables on the stack is helpful.

<p>To learn more about how to run GDB and the common issues that can
arise when using GDB, check out the following.
<ul>
<li><a href="gdb.html">GDB Sample Sessions</a> - definitely read this before starting the lab.
<li><A HREF="../gdb/gdb-refcard.pdf">GDB Reference Card</A></li>
<li><a href="../gdb/gdb_toc.html#SEC1">GDB Webpages TOC</a></li>
<li><a href="../gdb/gdb_25.html">GDB Webpages Index</a></li> 
</ul>

<p> To help you become familiar with gdb, run <kbd>make qemu-gdb</kbd> and
then fire up gdb in another window
(see <a href="gdb.html">GDB Sample Sessions</a>). Once you have two windows open, type in the gdb window:
<pre>
(gdb) <kbd>b syscall</kbd>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80002142: file kernel/syscall.c, line 243.
(gdb) <kbd>c</kbd>
Continuing.
[Switching to Thread 1.2]

Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:243
243     {
(gdb) <kbd>layout src</kbd>
(gdb) <kbd>backtrace</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The <tt>layout</tt> command splits the window in two, showing where
  gdb is in the source code. The <tt>backtrace</tt> prints out the
  stack backtrace</tt>.


  <div class="question">
    <p><b>1.</b> Looking at the backtrace output, which function
    called <tt>syscall</tt>?
  </div>

<p> Type <kbd>n</kbd> a few times to step pass <tt> struct proc *p = myproc();</tt>
    Once past this statement, type <kbd>p /x
    *p</kbd>, which prints the current process's <tt>proc struct</tt>
    (see <tt>kernel/proc.h></tt>) in hex.

<p> You will notice that a <tt>proc struct</tt> has a member <tt>trapframe</tt> which contains the proc's registers when a trap is processed.
    The value that <kbd>p /x *p</kbd> prints is the address of the <tt>trapframe</tt> member. To view the contents of <tt>trapframe</tt>,
    you must enter <kbd>p /x *p->trapframe</kbd>. This will show you the hex values of the registers saved on the trapframe.
    Alternatively, you can view the value of register a7, by entering <kbd>p /x (*p->trapframe)->a7</kbd>. Examine the use of parentheses
    in the command to disply the value of the register a7 in the <tt>trapframe</tt> structure.
    You may want to try entering <kbd>p /x *p->trapframe->a7</kbd> to help you better understand dereferencing C pointers.

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>2.</b> What is the value of <tt>p->trapframe->a7</tt> and what does that
    value represent?  (Hint: look <tt>user/initcode.S</tt>, the first
    user program xv6 starts.)
  </div>

<p>The processor is running in kernel mode, and we can print privileged
  registers such as <tt>sstatus</tt>
  (see <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf">RISC-V
    privileged instructions</a> for a description):

  <pre>
    (gdb) <kbd>p /x $sstatus</kbd>
  </pre>

   <div class="question">
     <p><b>3.</b> What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
   </div>

<p>In the subsequent part of this lab (or in following labs), it may
  happen that you make a programming error that causes the xv6 kernel
  to panic. For example, replace the statement <tt>num = p->trapframe->a7;</tt>
with
  <tt>num = * (int *) 0;</tt>
  at the beginning of <tt>syscall</tt>, run <kbd>make
  qemu</kbd>, and you will see:
  <pre>

panic: kerneltrap
  </pre>
Quit out of <tt>qemu</tt>.

<p>The privileged register <tt>scause</tt> contains the cause of the trap. When a trap is taken into S-mode, scause is written with a code indicating the event that caused the trap. Lookup what the value of 0xd (13) in <tt>scause</tt> means  (see <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf">RISC-V privileged instructions</a> for a description). 

<p>To track down the source of a kernel page-fault panic, search for
  the <tt>sepc</tt> value printed for the panic you just saw
  in the
  file <tt>kernel/kernel.asm</tt>, which contains the assembly for the
  compiled kernel.

  <div class="question">
    <p><b>4.</b> Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at.
    Which register corresponds to the varialable <tt>num</tt>?
  </div>

<p>To inspect the state of the processor and the kernel at the
faulting instruction, fire up gdb, and set a breakpoint at the
faulting <tt>epc</tt>, like this. Note, be sure the use the address you saw displayed in the <tt>panic: kerneltrap</tt>.

  </div>

<p>Note that <tt>scause</tt> was printed by the kernel panic above,
  but often you need to look at additional info to track down the
  problem that caused the panic.  For example, to find out which user
  process was running when the kernel paniced, you can print out the
  process's name:
  <pre>
    (gdb) <kbd>p p->name</kbd>
  </pre>

    <div class="question">
      <p><b>7.</b> What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel

<p>This concludes a brief introduction to tracking down bugs with gdb.

<p>This section and the links at the top of this section contain helpful information on gdb.

<h2>System calls for Random Integers  <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  <p>In this assignment you will add system calls <code>rseed</code> and <code>rint</code> that
  seed a random integer generator and generate random integers. 
  This assignment introduces you to the Xv6 system call mechanism.
  You'll create a
  new <tt>rseed</tt> system call that will seed the random integer generator. It shall
  take one argument, an integer "seed", that establishes the starting seed
  for the Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG).
  You'll create a new <tt>rint</tt> system call that will return an pseudo random integer.
  It shall take one argument, an integer <tt>max</tt> such that the random number returned is 
  between 0 and <tt>max</tt> minus one. Both <tt>rseed</tt> and <tt>rint</tt> shall return -1 on an error.
</div>

<p>The following are your requirements for <tt>rseed</tt> and <tt>rint</tt>

<ul>

<li><p>Your implementation of <tt>rint</tt> shall use a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Linear Congruential Generator </a>.
</li>

<li><p>You shall create a static variable to contain the <tt>rseedvalue</tt>, which shall be 0 by default.
</li>

<li><p>Calls to <tt>rseed(int seedvalue)</tt> shall update the value of <tt>rseedvalue</tt> to be <tt>seedvalue</tt>.
</li>

<li><p>One definition of a Linear Congruential Generator is defined by the algorithm 
<pre>
X<sub>n+1</sub> = (a * X<sub>n</sub> + c) bitwiseAnd m
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>The static variable <tt>rseedvalue</tt> shall be used for <tt>X</tt>.
</li>

<li><p>The number 1103515245 shall be used for <tt>a</tt>.
</li>

<li><p>The number 12345 shall be used for <tt>b</tt>.
</li>

<li><p>The C macro for <tt>MY_RAND_MAX</tt> shall be used for <tt>m</tt>.
<pre>
#define MY_RAND_MAX ((1U << 31) - 1)
</pre>
Notice the expression for <tt>MY_RAND_MAX</tt> results in <tt>0x7fffffff</tt>, which is the largest positive 32-bit number. When you use a bitwise and in the expression
<pre>
(1103515245 * rseedv + 12345) & MY_RAND_MAX
</pre>
you are creating a positive number.
</li>

<li><p>We provide a <tt>randomtest</tt> user-level program that calls your
  <tt>rseed</tt> and <tt>rinter</tt> system calls (see <tt>user/randomtest.c</tt>).
  When you're done, you should see output like this:

<pre>
$ randomtest 555

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
  <ul>

    <li><p>Add <tt>$U/_randomtest</tt> to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt></li>
    <li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd> and you will see that the
	compiler cannot compile <tt>user/randomtest.c</tt>, because the

		<li><p>The <tt>Makefile</tt> invokes the perl

    <li><p>Add a <tt>sys_rseed()</tt> function

      <ul>
      <li><tt>sys_rseed()</tt> is called when a user program calls <tt>rseed(555)</tt>.</li>

      <li>Calling <tt>rseed(555)</tt> places 555 in register <tt>a0</tt>, 
          places the system number associated with <tt>rseed</tt> in register <tt>a7</tt>,

      <li>The <tt>ecall</tt> instruction generates a trap that changes the CPU mode from user to supervisor.</li>
      <li>During initialization, the function <tt>main</tt> in <tt>main.c</tt> calls <tt>trapinithart</tt> to install

      <li>The function <tt>kernelvec</tt> is an assembly function in <tt>kernelvec.S</tt> that saves registers

      <li><tt>kerneltrap</tt> is a function in <tt>trap.c</tt></li>

     </li>
  </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <p><b>8.</b> The system calls for random numbers were a nice introduction to system calls.
      You learned how to add OS system calls to the Xv6 OS.
      Do they have to be system calls? Examine the files <tt>kernel/string.c</tt> and <tt>user/umalloc.c</tt> and
      how they fit into Xv6 before answering this question. 
  </div>

<h2>System call tracing <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  <p>In this assignment you will add a system call tracing feature that
  may help you when debugging later labs.  You'll create a
  new <tt>trace</tt> system call that will control tracing. It should
  take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which
  system calls to trace.  For example, to trace the fork system call,
  a program calls <tt>trace(1 << SYS_fork)</tt>, where <tt>SYS_fork</tt> is a
  syscall number from <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>. You have to modify
  the xv6 kernel to print out a line when each system call is about to
  return, if the system call's number is set in the mask.
  The line should contain the
  process id, the name of the system call and the
  return value; you don't need to print the system call
  arguments. The <tt>trace</tt> system call should enable tracing
  for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks,
  but should not affect other processes.
</div>

<p>Let's first consider the <tt>int trace(int)</tt> function prototype
  that is added to <tt>user.h</tt>. The return code is 0 for success and
  -1 for failure. The argument is an integer, which is a 32-bit quantity.
  Each bit corresponds to a system call number, which is defined in <tt>syscall.h</tt>. 
  For example, bit 1 specifies
  to trace <tt>fork</tt> system calls because <tt>fork</tt> has number 1
  as its system call number. This means if you make a call <tt>trace(2)</tt>,
  you are tracing <tt>fork</tt> system calls because 2 has bit 1 set. 
  Another example is <tt>trace(0x20)</tt>
  traces <tt>read</tt> system calls because <tt>read</tt> has number 5 
  as its system call number and 0x20 has bit 5 set. The C expression <tt>1<<5</tt>
  results in the number 0x20, because 1 is shifted 5 bits to the left.
  If you want to trace both <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>read</tt> system calls, 
  you would call <tt>trace(0x22)</tt> which sets bits 1 and 5.

<p>When calling the <tt>trace</tt> user program from the command line, the
  examples show the first parameter as in decimal integer. The samples provided
  discuss translating this decimal integar parameter to specific system calls.

<p>We provide a <tt>trace</tt> user-level program that runs another
  program with tracing enabled (see <tt>user/trace.c</tt>). When you're
  done, you should see output like this:

<ul>
<li><p>In the first example trace runs grep tracing just the
read system call. The 32 is <tt>1&lt;&lt;SYS_read</tt>. 
<pre>
$ trace 32 grep hello README
3: syscall read -> 1023
3: syscall read -> 966
3: syscall read -> 70
3: syscall read -> 0
$
</pre>
<li>In the second example, trace runs grep while tracing all system calls; the
2147483647 has all 31 low bits set. 
<pre>
$ trace 2147483647 grep hello README
4: syscall trace -> 0
4: syscall exec -> 3
4: syscall open -> 3
4: syscall read -> 1023
4: syscall read -> 966
4: syscall read -> 70
4: syscall read -> 0
4: syscall close -> 0
$
</pre>
<li>In the third example, the program isn't traced, so no trace output is printed. 
<pre>
$ grep hello README
$
</pre>
<li> In the fourth example
the fork system calls of all the descendants of the <tt>forkforkfork</tt> test
in <tt>usertests</tt> are being traced. Your solution is correct if your
program behaves as shown above (though the process IDs may be
different).
<pre>
$ trace 2 usertests forkforkfork
usertests starting
test forkforkfork: 407: syscall fork -> 408
408: syscall fork -> 409
409: syscall fork -> 410
410: syscall fork -> 411
409: syscall fork -> 412
410: syscall fork -> 413
409: syscall fork -> 414
411: syscall fork -> 415
...
$
</pre>
</ul>


<h3>Some Hints</h3>

<p>Many of these hints are similar (but maybe briefer) to the hints for the system calls for random numbers.

  <ul>

    <li><p>Add <tt>$U/_trace</tt> to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt>

    <li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd> and you will see that the
	compiler cannot compile <tt>user/trace.c</tt>, because the
	user-space stubs for the system call don't exist yet: add a
	prototype for the system call to <tt>user/user.h</tt>, a stub
	to <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, and a syscall number
	to <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>.  The Makefile invokes the perl
	script <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, which produces <tt>user/usys.S</tt>,
	the actual system call stubs, which use the
	RISC-V <tt>ecall</tt> instruction to transition to the
	kernel. Once you fix the compilation issues,
	run <kbd>trace 32 grep hello README</kbd>; it will fail
	because you haven't implemented the system call in the kernel
	yet.

    <li><p>Add a <tt>sys_trace()</tt> function
	in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> that implements the new system
	call by remembering its argument in a new variable in
	the <tt>proc</tt> structure (see <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt>). The
	functions to retrieve system call arguments from user space are
	in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt>, and you can see examples
        of their use in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
  This programming is just like the random number system calls,
  which contain additional information on this step.
   </li>

    <li><p>Modify <tt>fork()</tt> (see <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>) to copy
    the trace mask from the parent to the child process. 
    <tt>fork()</tt> creates a child process, which is identical to its
    parent. Both the parent and child have <tt>struc proc</tt> that define
    the process attributes. The parent has a trace mask stored in its
    <tt>struct proc</tt>, which is what you added in the previous step.
    You must copy this trace mask to the child.
    </li>


    <li><p>Modify the <tt>syscall()</tt> function
	in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt> to print the trace output. You will need to add an array of syscall names to index into.
    Make sure that the indices of the array use the <tt>SYS_fork</tt> names defined in <tt>syscall.h</tt>. For example
<pre>
static char *syscall_name[] = {
[SYS_fork]    "fork",
[SYS_exit]    "exit",
...
</pre>

    </li><p>The format for each line printed by your trace in <tt>syscall()</tt> is
<pre>
"%d: syscall %s -> %d\n" pid, syscallName, syscallReturnValue"
</pre>
If you study the code in <tt>syscall()</tt>, I am sure you can find the variables that 
correspond to <tt>pid</tt>, <tt>syscallName</tt>, and <tt>syscallReturnValue</tt>.
These variables may be members of structures.

    <li><p>If a test case passes when you run it inside qemu directly but
  you get a timeout when running the tests using <tt>make grade</tt>, try
  testing your implementation on the CPSC server. Some of tests in this lab can be a bit
  too computationally intensive for your local machine (especially if you use
  WSL).</li>

  </ul>

<h2>Sysinfo <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  <p>In this assignment you will add a system call, <tt>sysinfo</tt>,
  that collects information about the running system.  The system call
  takes one argument: a pointer to a <tt>struct sysinfo</tt>
  (see <tt>kernel/sysinfo.h</tt>). The kernel should fill out the
  fields of this struct: the <tt>freemem</tt> field should be set
  to the number of bytes of free memory, and the <tt>nproc</tt>
  field should be set to the number of processes whose <tt>state</tt>
  is not <tt>UNUSED</tt>.
  We provide a test program <tt>sysinfotest</tt>; you pass this
  assignment if it prints "sysinfotest: OK".
</div>

<h3>Some Hints</h3>
<ul>

<li><p>Add <tt>$U/_sysinfotest</tt> to UPROGS in Makefile

<li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd>; <tt>user/sysinfotest.c</tt> will
  fail to compile. 
</li>
<li>Add the system call sysinfo, following the same
  steps as in the previous assignments of this lab. You can refer 
  to  <a href="#refsystemcalls" >Reference: Xv6 System Calls</a> for the steps.
  To declare the prototype for
  sysinfo() <tt>in user/user.h</tt> you need predeclare the existence
  of <tt>struct sysinfo</tt>:
  <pre>
    struct sysinfo;
    int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *);
  </pre>
</li>
<li>Once you fix the compilation issues, run
  <kbd>sysinfotest</kbd>; it will fail because you haven't
  implemented the system call in the kernel yet.
</li>

<li><p>Your <tt>sysinfo</tt> will need some helper functions in the kernel.
These functions are not system calls because only the kernel (namely <tt>sysinfo</tt>) calls them; however,
you must put their function prototypes in <tt>defs.h</tt>.
<ul>
<li><tt>get_freemem()</tt> - place this function in <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>.
Implementing this function requires you to walk the free memory list
counting the free bytes. It returns the number of bytes of free memory.
<ul>
<li>The free memory is pointed to by the variable <tt>kmem.freelist</tt>, which 
is type <tt>struct run *</tt>, which is defined in <tt>kalloc.c</tt>.
<li>You must traverse the free list and compute the number of free bytes.
<li>The free list is a list of free pages, where each page is <tt>PGSIZE</tt> bytes.
<li>The macro <tt>PGSIZE</tt> is defined to be 4096 in the file <tt>riscv.h</tt>.
<li>Notice that the free list has a lock <tt>kmem.lock</tt> that you must
<tt>acquire</tt> before traversing the free list and <tt>release</tt> after
traversing the free list.
</ul>
<li><tt>get_nproc()</tt> - place this function in <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.
Implementing this function requires you to iterate through the procs
counting those that are not <tt>UNUSED</tt>. It returns the number of
procs that are not <tt>UNUSED</tt>.
<ul>
<li>Procs are stored in the array <tt>struct proc proc[NPROC];</tt>.
<li>You must itterate through the array <tt>struct proc proc</tt> 
counting the procs that are not <tt>UNUSED</tt>.
</ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><tt>sysinfo</tt> must copy a <tt>struct sysinfo</tt> back to user
  space; see <tt>sys_fstat()</tt> (<tt>kernel/sysfile.c</tt>)
  and <tt>filestat()</tt> (<tt>kernel/file.c</tt>) for examples of how
  to do that using <tt>copyout()</tt>.
</li>
